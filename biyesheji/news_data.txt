"i also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding mr. pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt."read more

1	nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the confederate monument on the front lawn of the franklin county courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.the rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people—women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of confederate soldiers. “we’re very proud of it,” says linda stanley, managing director of the franklin county historical society in rocky mount, virginia, 25 miles southeast of roanoke. “this whole county’s very, very patriotic.”story continued belowthis was the way skirmishes over confederate history have often gone—history is replaced, not rewritten. that is, until last year, when white supremacist dylann roof gunned down nine people at an african-american church in charleston, south carolina. the massacre set off a national debate about confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the confederate flag from the south carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.but for every nationally publicized debate like the one over south carolina’s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like franklin county. and this is especially true in virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the confederacy, has more confederate monuments—223—than any other state. virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the “new south” and the still powerful nostalgia of the old dominion, and it’s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.though a quinnipiac university poll last summer found virginians evenly divided on the governor’s decision to remove the confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. when city leaders in danville, on virginia’s southern border, voted to remove a confederate flag from the grounds of the sutherlin mansion—known as the last capitol of the confederacy—confederate preservationists struck back. they filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.that ruling—along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state—prompted the republican delegate from franklin county to demand in january a blanket protection for what has been a feature of southern urban landscapes for more than a century. charles poindexter introduced a bill in the general assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. “if you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you’re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country—to learn the good, the bad and ugly,” poindexter says.many of his colleagues in the virginia legislature agreed with him. but in march, democratic governor terry mcauliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. some historians and civic leaders think the debate over confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.“every little statue’s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,” says edward ayers, former president of the university of richmond and noted civil war historian. “african-americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they’re using it for.”***mark whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall confederate monument in portsmouth, virginia, when he was a kid. shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. “my ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,” whitaker says.now, as an african-american city council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of olde towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. “these monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,” he says.many of the confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when civil war veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. it was also the era immediately following reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the south and whites aimed to reassert power through jim crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the ku klux klan. granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.but even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, whitaker has battled to get portsmouth’s monument removed. last summer, attorney fred taylor, who also represented confederate preservationists in the danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. “we believe the monument protection act covers the monument in danville, covers the monument in portsmouth,” taylor says. he argues that the original virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so “there has been protection all along.”when the circuit court judge ruled against him in danville, taylor appealed the case to the virginia supreme court. so far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.back in portsmouth, the debate continues. some residents don’t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument—a position whitaker finds ridiculous. “why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we’re concerned about cost?”he says the portsmouth city council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the november elections. “we’re on solid legal grounds to remove it,” he says. “we just need four votes.”***other virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their confederate monuments. in may, charlottesville convened a blue ribbon commission on race, memorials, and public spaces. although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of robert e. lee in a public park, mayor mike signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city’s entire historic landscape.he asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an african-american cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a confederate boy in front of the courthouse. members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to african-american leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. there might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. the goal, signer says, is to change the narrative of charlottesville “by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.” the commission is slated to give its recommendations to the city council in december.in the wealthy, heavily democratic city of alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the appomattox statue in the middle of old town, which depicts a defeated confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. the united daughters of the confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the virginia general assembly. also, as the advisory group noted, appomattox is one of the rare confederate statues that marks a historic site—the place where the 17th virginia regiment gathered to withdraw from union occupation of the city in 1861. the group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.“black lives matter” is spray painted on a monument to former confederate president jefferson davis in richmond, virginia, in june 2015. | ap photorichmond, the former capital of the confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to confederate leaders. it’s also a majority-black city. in june 2015, someone scrawled “black lives matter” on the statue of former confederate president jefferson davis. yet mayor dwight jones has not called for the monuments’ removal. instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders—such as the bronze of tennis legend arthur ashe, who was born in richmond, that the city erected in 1995. “rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of virginia’s history,” jones said in a statement last summer.delegate poindexter tends to agree with jones, although he’s fuzzy on the specifics. asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing confederate monuments, he says, “it’s far better than tearing down the current ones.”in his eyes, the era in which the confederate monuments were erected is “irrelevant.” “they need to be respected,” he says. “they didn’t know what we know today. that’s why these monuments are important.”ayers says many people who push to preserve confederate monuments share this attitude. “the white south has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the united states,” he says. “they’ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. it’s an amalgam of power and weakness.”“they’re meant to do work,” ayers says. “the work that they were meant to do, in some ways they’re still doing: saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.”***in franklin county, the power struggle is deeply personal. stanley says the area sent about 3,000 confederate soldiers to what she calls “the war between the states.” veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the united daughters of the confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. they dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.one of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was booker t. washington, the famed african-american educator who was born into slavery on a farm in franklin county in 1856. in 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. as far as stanley knows, washington did contribute some amount, “we just don’t have a copy of the actual check.”poindexter says franklin county “lost hundreds of its best men” in the civil war, and for decades afterward, reconstruction was “a horrible process” that had a big impact on the region.today, franklin county is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. they elected poindexter, a conservative christian with an “a” rating from the national rifle association, to the general assembly for the first time in 2007. in 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state’s median of $64,792. its residents voted republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported poindexter’s efforts to save war monuments. “we didn’t want anybody pulling any monuments down,” stanley says.soon after the county replaced the confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the naacp suggested that a statue of booker t. washington be erected beside it. other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring african-americans who contributed to the county’s civil war effort. the county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.civil war memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the roanoke region, says landon howard, president of visit virginia’s blue ridge. “to be candid, we really do not get hardly any american civil war visitation here.”yet locals have their own loyalties. every year, the franklin county historical society celebrates veterans memorial day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. according to the society’s website, “special emphasis is placed on veterans of the war between the states as this war touched literally every household in the county.”confederate general jubal early was born in franklin county, and he’s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. “he became the primary spokesman for the lost cause and became the overwhelming authority on published confederate history,” says the website of the jubal a. early homeplace.speaking by phone from his farm in franklin county, poindexter isn’t ready to surrender, either. he doesn’t know whether he’ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn’t ruled it out. “if you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?” he says. “you can’t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.”lisa rab is a

now that mr. ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. so mr. sherman and the editors at new york hired some muscle. ...“[i]n the summer of 2012,

1	giuliani slams lester holt for fact-checking like candy crowleypresidential debate moderator lester holt pulled two candy crowleys, former new york mayor rudy giuliani said tuesday, accusing of the “nbc nightly news” anchor of mirroring crowley’s infamous mitt romney fact-check twice on monday night.in an interview with “fox and friends,” giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then i went home and i watched lester holt do candy crowley at least twice.”story continued belowdonald trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of monday’s faceoff, warned holt last week not to be like crowley, who interrupted romney in 2012 after the then-republican nominee said it took president barack obama 14 days to call the attack in benghazi, libya, an “act of terror.” (politifact rated romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed.")giuliani took issue with holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the iraq war.a federal judge in new york ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as holt suggested, giuliani argued.“the thing that’s wrong is lester holt said straight out: stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. lester holt is not a lawyer,” giuliani said. “he’s wrong. it was decided in 1959 by earl warren. it is still the law of the land.”the former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of america” but gave hillary clinton a pass for siding with holt “because she failed the bar exam.”“but i’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “and i’d like to know: when did a moderator become a fact-checker? and if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.”“i’m a lawyer. i’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” giuliani said, after co-steve doocy noted that giuliani was fact-checking holt. “i’m a lawyer. am i angry about it? i thought after candy crowley we saw the last of it. what holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. he is dead wrong.”giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether trump supported the iraq war.“i saw the tape, and he opposed the iraq war before the iraq war,” giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with howard stern.“a hundred million last night were misled by lester holt and so-called lawyer hillary clinton,” giuliani said.authors:

'what did [donald trump] say now?'" as kaine and members of the audience laughed."it is part of the role," kaine said, declining to specifically mention pence or his defense of donald trump. "i don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work i have to do to tell people hillary’s story," kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as midwesterners who "both grew up in republican families ... in small business families" and "in religious households."kaine added, "i kind of know the vibe. i know that for example, for her it’s not easy for her to talk about herself, that’s just not the way we were raised, but it’s easier for me to talk about her so that’s something i like to do is to tell stories about things she’s done that really show who she is as a person and the kind of president she’ll be."authors:
1	an anti-donald trump super pac is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this monday at hofstra university in new york.the group, the not who we are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. a new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to trump's message.“i don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus.another chimes in, “he makes me terrified.”and a third simply says, “i don’t want him on campus.”the not who we are campaign plans to run the ad on twitter and facebook ahead of and during monday’s debate.“since the donald himself is coming to campus, these hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as americans and not who they are as part of the hofstra community,” not who we are’s campaign manager josh hendler said in a statement.hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” trump by writing open letters.“we’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says.the site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers.one recent letter, written by hofstra student rob bielunas, reads in part: "as a community, hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas mr. trump has used to get where he is today. his hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the hofstra community, stand up against donald j trump’s run for president."
1	glenn beck shares buyer's remorse on cruz endorsementglenn beck, a former ted cruz surrogate, suggested monday that he’d have been better off backing marco rubio in the republican presidential primary and laced into the texas senator for throwing his support behind donald trump late last week.“for the very first time, i heard ted cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it’s my fault,” beck said on his radio show.story continued below“it’s my fault,” beck continued. “i should have said: ‘you know who can win? you know who could beat hillary clinton? marco rubio, and i disagree with him on the gang of eight, and there’s about 80 percent that i do agree with him on, and he’s kind of a politician, but he’s a different kind of politician. he’s a young politician. he’s a hispanic, he can win. let’s go for it.’"instead, beck sought “a truly honorable man” in cruz — “and that will always let you down,” he said. but while lamenting the fact that cruz chose to be a politician friday, beck said that he believes the texas firebrand is still a good man.“i’m not gonna condemn him. he is still, i believe, a good man,” beck said. “he is just a politician first. i’ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that’s my fault. he is a politician.”for his part, cruz insisted to beck monday that he was trying to show the trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the republican national convention in which he encouraged republicans to vote their conscience in november.after beck noted that cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (vote for trump, for clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).“so a man who has principles who says there are lines i will not cross — it’s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘yes, glenn, he is fit to be president of the united states,’ i still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” beck asked.“you are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,” cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said clinton would do to america.beck, however, wasn’t satisfied. “this is information that you had in cleveland — and hang on just a second before you respond — you had all of this information. you had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that donald trump is a sociopathic liar,” beck said. “so you had all this information. have you spent an enormous amount of time with donald trump? do you have new information that has made you say: ‘oh, my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar. he is not the guy i very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there’s a reason to believe him.’”despite his “significant disagreements” with trump, cruz said, it’s a binary choice.“i’m asking for new information. i’m asking you for new information,” beck said. “you knew all the things that you’re saying today. the time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. why now? what’s new?”cruz pointed to the trump campaign’s release of possible conservative supreme court nominees, a list that includes cruz ally utah sen. mike lee. he suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the supreme court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee mike pence when he asked the texas senator what it would take to get him on board.“we discussed the supreme court as being one of the great checks protecting the constitution and the rule of law, and the trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,” cruz said.after stu burguiere pressed cruz on why he would believe anything trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. “now, with respect to the justices donald trump would nominate, i know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,” cruz said. “i hope that he would follow through on that commitment. one never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ‘i will nominate from these 21,’ i think creates a dynamic where, compared to hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice.”cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his rnc remarks were a swipe against trump, adding that he’s always been “never hillary” but not ever “never trump.” he also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what ronald reagan said about gerald ford and what ted kennedy said about jimmy carter.“my speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,” cruz said. “both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. one of the unfortunate things about the reaction is cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that i was essentially embracing never trump. i have never been a never trumper.”after cruz’s appearance, beck said cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed trump. “he could have come on and said, ‘look, guys, here’s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,’ and i know that, because so are mine,” he said. “’my donors, who are all in with the gop, they’re all saying i’ll never fund — i won’t fund you for the senate. i won’t fund you for the run in 2020. and i have to make a decision. so the question is do i completely shut myself out of this game or do i play the game as much as i possibly can?’”authors:

1	story highlights clinton is offering voters an implicit contrast with trumpclinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilitieschappaqua, new york (cnn) hillary clinton's economic speech on wednesday in orlando will focus on how the united states can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with republican nominee donald trump.clinton, an aide said tuesday, will propose an economy that "welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect."wednesday's speech is clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about trump. clinton has so far given "stronger together" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.while those speeches have focused more on clinton, they have not been devoid of trump contrast. in all three speeches, clinton has tried to keep her talk of trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. and wednesday's speech will be no different.read more

1	on the night of september 26, as the house lights dim in the mack complex at hofstra university and the tv cameras go live, millions of americans will be riveted to the scene. will donald trump seem well prepared? will hillary clinton’s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?experience suggests it’s hard to make a positive breakthrough—especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. but what is possible is a serious unforced error.story continued belowover the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe—a mistake live on tv that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. what the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how americans evaluate their performances. and although debates don’t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters’ impressions—which matters on election day.for both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. donald trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds—which could lead to an unforced error by hillary clinton. hillary clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under trump’s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. if either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.1. 1960: nixon sweats while debating jfkfamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. after eight years as vice president, richard nixon was running to inherit the white house from the enormously popular dwight eisenhower. his challenger was john f. kennedy, the charismatic young massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.on september 26, at the candidates’ first debate, nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. but he looked terrible. famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. but that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. as a result, he looked peaked.video: the biggest unforced errors in debate history from richard nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to george h.w. bush checking his watch before an audience question—here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in u.s. history.during their televised rumble, nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. his pale color and five o'clock shadow didn’t help. all of which undercut his performance against kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.2. 1976: ford and carter freeze in a moment of crisisa more dramatic moment occurred on september 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in philadelphia’s walnut street theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which president gerald ford and then-governor jimmy carter awkwardly stood still on stage. the broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that “saturday night live” could imagine. moderators robert mcneil and jim lehrer kept talking as the candidates “stood helplessly like two hollywood stand-ins,” wrote jules witcover in the washington post.years later, ford admitted that “i suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but i think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren’t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.” in the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.3. 1980: carter’s grim-faced critiques seem too self-seriousin politics, brevity can be a virtue. during his only debate with ronald reagan in the fall of 1980, jimmy carter didn’t get that lesson.in front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, carter was hoping to paint ronald reagan as a creature of the far right—someone like barry goldwater, the gop nominee whom lyndon johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. as reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable republican, carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how reagan had opposed medicare in 1964.while carter looked grim on the attack, reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: “there you go again,” he said with a laugh. the line undercut carter’s entire argument, making reagan look like the bigger man.4. 1984: mondale lets reagan’s one-liner negate a serious weaknessduring 1984’s first debate, reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. he stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. his opponent, former vice president walter mondale, was crisp and sharp. in contrast, reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. lou cannon wrote that reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser stu spencer “that he had flopped.” the wall street journal’s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: “new question in race: is oldest president now showing his age?”fortunately for reagan, he came back with a vengeance. in a later debate, when baltimore sun journalist henry trewitt asked reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, reagan had a quip for the ages: “i will not make age an issue in this campaign. i will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”the audience erupted in laughter, including mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.5. 1988: dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal questionperhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by cnn anchor bernard shaw to massachusetts gov. michael dukakis at the second debate of 1988.dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. the night before the debate, at 2 a.m., shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. and so he began the debate with it: “governor, if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?”reporters were shocked, but dukakis seemed unperturbed. in a clinical and dispassionate manner, dukakis simply said “no, i don’t bernard, and i think you know that i’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. i don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and i think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.”it was as though dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. “it was a question about dukakis’s values and emotions,” his campaign director, susan estrich, later recalled. “when he answered by talking policy, i knew we lost the election.”6. 1992: bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a questionduring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to george h.w. bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with bill clinton and ross perot.right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average americans, bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. “only 10 more minutes of this crap,” bush would later say he was thinking at the time.checking the time would’ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did—during a debate in which ordinary americans posed questions to the presidential candidates—it seemed like bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. for a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.7. 2000: gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with bushentering the debates in 2000, vice president al gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in george w. bush. gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show american voters that bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.during the first debate, gore’s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with bush backfired big time. at several points, microphones caught gore loudly sighing in response to bush’s answers, which played into republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. and as bush criticized the democrat’s plans for their “fuzzy math,” gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.at the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: gore walked right up to bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. looking up with an annoyed glance, bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making gore’s action look odd as the audience laughed.donna brazile, who ran gore’s campaign, believed that gore won the debates on policy but “on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing … many of us remember the split-screen, and al gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at george bush, and basically he started to sigh.”8. 2004: bush cannot contain his irritation at kerryafter the first debate of the general election in 2000, president bush came under criticism when he couldn’t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, senator john kerry, made about bush’s record.though bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against vice president al gore, the critics weren’t so kind to bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to kerry speak. the democratic national committee didn’t wait long to pounce on the president. in their online video, “faces of frustration,” viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with bush’s angry looks on the right side.***appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. what the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of twitter, facebook and youtube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.and on september 26, 56 years to the day since nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with jfk, we’ll see what happens.julian e. zelizer is a political historian at princeton university and a

1	donald trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. the city of new york recently ended “stop and frisk,” but trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former new york city mayor rudy giuliani. from politico:in a pre-taped interview on fox news scheduled to air wednesday night, trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community” and “black-on-black crime.” trump responded by proposing that “stop-and-frisk” policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. “i would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,” trump told the questioner.stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by new york city residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and latino residents. they were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.when the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn’t done anything wrong.former us district court judge shira scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as “destructive” in an interview with buzzfeed. she added:“in short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.”featured image via flickr
1	obama claims it will be a personal insult if you don’t vote for hillary [video]this past saturday night our divider-in-chief was at it again. this time he lectured the attendees at the 46th annual legislative conference phoenix awards dinner of the congressional black caucus. what did he lecture them about? hillary. yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn’t vote for hillary.here’s what he said:“my name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. tolerance is on the ballot. democracy is on the ballot. justice is on the ballot. good schools are on the ballot. ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. and there is one candidate who will advance those things. and there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. there’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. it all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the african-american community, i will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. you want to give me a good sendoff? go vote!”× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy nowwe definitely want to give you a sendoff mr. president. and it can’t be soon enough. but this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. get over it. if not voting for hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many americans of every color who will not be voting for hillary. and your legacy? you’ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you’ve implemented. no one needs to help you insult your legacy, it’s a mess.the democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. but the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they must vote for. so save the preaching for those who want to hear it. your legacy is one of causing division and hillary will pick up where you left off, if she is elected. and that can’t be fixed. trump 2016.
1	ap photo backtalk robert kennedy would have hated donald trump the gop candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.writing as a former legislative assistant to senator robert f. kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of hillary clinton for president, i was disappointed to see in politico the screed written by my former colleague, adam walinsky, excoriating clinton’s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that donald trump should therefore be elected president. it is one thing to disagree with secretary clinton, which walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to donald trump.we should be clear that walinsky’s critique is not confined to clinton. he lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of clinton but also of president obama and almost the entire democratic party. the analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is trump.story continued belowthe question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. president eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. the 21st century version begins with the iraq war, which was originated by a republican president. i am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that presidents obama, clinton and carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. the question here is whether donald trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.walinsky finds in trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with nato and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the u.s. or to himself, and pledges that america’s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. “america first,” trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of charles lindbergh to mind—before excoriating president obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the islamic state.to compare john f. kennedy and robert f. kennedy to donald trump is—well, i won’t finish the sentence. yes, robert kennedy turned against the vietnam war, but not because he felt that america should retreat from the world. he opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of american interests. the result, as we know, was the death of vietnamese and americans and others who should not have died. jfk and rfk were internationalists. they understood that world war ii left the united states with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. they understood that america must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. they understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. they made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.walinsky quotes robert kennedy’s statement that if any member of the excomm other than john f. kennedy had been president during the cuban missile crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. ask yourself what a president trump might have done in that moment. “restraint” is not the word that comes to mind.this is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the united states should have seized iraq’s oil resources as “spoils to the victor.”yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. but electing donald trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. the answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither american security interests nor egregious human rights violations—a topic in which donald trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for vladimir putin reflects.all the evidence, provided again and again by donald trump’s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle—a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. he is like the weather in new england: if you don’t like it, wait a minute. we do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. we do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.even if walinsky’s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to donald trump. of all occasions to break ranks with the democratic party, this is the most inappropriate. of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of john and robert kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious i have ever seen.to say that i am disappointed by what walinsky has done is an understatement. america, in this election, faces an existential question—and history will judge us by our answer. walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.peter edelman is the carmack waterhouse professor of law and public policy at georgetown university law center.
1	a billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. but in this case it’s not donald trump. it’s jim justice, the democratic candidate for governor in west virginia and a coal baron to boot.like trump, justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. and like trump, justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing hillary clinton and barack obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. as west virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-june. justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot democrat in one of trump’s strongest states.story continued belowwest virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a metronews west virginia poll released earlier this month showed trump with a 49–31 advantage over hillary clinton, who won only 36 percent to bernie sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s may 10 primary. in an era of declining split-ticket voting, justice must outperform clinton by double digits to win.that’s led to a dynamic in which west virginia’s gop candidate for governor, state senate president bill cole, is embracing trump while justice is distancing himself from clinton. it’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races.“across the nation, democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use trump as a weapon. in this race, it’s pretty clear democrats are trying to localize, because trump is not a drag but an asset for cole,” says kyle kondik, managing editor of larry sabato’s crystal ball at the university of virginia’s center for politics. “this is one of the few places in the country where republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than democrats are.”in this race, trump isn’t a drag on republicans; he’s an asset.the reason is simple: coal. republicans have dominated appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming obama for the industry's decline. it’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. and justice definitely qualifies: he inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the east. that growth included the 2009 sale of his bluestone coal corp. to russia’s oao mechel for $568 million. then the coal slump hit, and last year justice bought bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.cole, the republican candidate, has more elective experience than justice, but he’s no establishment insider. owner of bill cole automall and other businesses, cole is finishing only his first term in the west virginia senate, having previously served a few months in the house of delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. however, cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.in a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.“if you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant trump win and a giant sanders win,” says scott crichlow, associate professor of political science at west virginia university. “if you look at trump, look at sanders, look at justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.”justice is running as a conservative democrat, not unlike former governor and current u.s. sen. joe manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. he’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in february 2015, when he became a democrat. however, he says he won’t vote for clinton and dismissed cole’s claim that he supports obama as “complete dog snot.”and while justice spokesman grant herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “jim is no politician,” says herring. “he is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.”at the moment, it looks like that approach is working: a metronews west virginia poll released september 3 showed justice running away with the race at 46 percent, cole with 32 percent, mountain party candidate charlotte pritt with 8 percent, and libertarian david moran with 5 percent.many doubt the veracity of the metronews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including cole spokesman kent gates, agree that justice is winning. “do i think justice has a lead? yes,” says gates. “do i think it’s double digits? no.”some of that is because justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the gop’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be democrat kryptonite around appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.“if you’re going to win in west virginia, you better be running against hillary clinton,” says dave “mudcat” saunders, a western virginia political consultant known for his so-called bubba strategy, designed to help democrats appeal to white working-class voters. saunders, who has said he’s voting for trump, says voters don’t trust clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “she said she’s going to put coal out of business. west virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. they want their dignity. they want their jobs.”if you’re going to win in west virginia, you better be running against hillary clinton,” says one democratic strategist.but saunders doesn’t have kind words for justice either: “he’s screwed every coal operator in west virginia at one time or another.”cole sees that reputation as his big opening. his spokesman, gates, says the republican campaign will open up attacks on justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “jim justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of west virginia,” gates says. “his legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.”that record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. in a 2014 series on delinquent mines, npr reported that justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. that same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three justice companies for reclamation violations at tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.the problems have persisted. this year in kentucky, justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. that’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid kentucky taxes. in southwest virginia, tazewell county officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. when 2015 west virginia property taxes became delinquent in april, justice owed more than $3.9 million.the pattern apparently extends to justice’s other businesses, as well: two companies sued the greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the pga tournament, eventually settling out of court.justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an appalachian environmental activist. the cole campaign going negative on justice might not push those green voters to vote republican, but it might tip them toward pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the mountain party, the west virginia affiliate of the green party. pritt served eight years in the state legislature and is making her third run for governor. the last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.both cole and justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in november faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.according to the u.s. census, west virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong asian economy.mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— alpha natural resources, arch coal, patriot coal, peabody energy and walter energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. while the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.the coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt west virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. the reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. in this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. he previously owned wintergreen resort in virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy. since then, he’s brought an annual pga tournament and the new orleans saints’ training camp to the greenbrier.in late june, a month and a half after justice won the democratic nomination and two weeks before the greenbrier classic pga tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the greenbrier and the communities around it when west virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in greenbrier county, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.justice canceled the pga event and closed the greenbrier resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. he shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the greenbrier’s reopening date. should he win in november, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.whether justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. sabato’s crystal ball recently moved the west virginia governor’s race from “leans republican” to “toss-up.” “we’re being cautious because of the fact that justice will need to run so far ahead of clinton,” kondik says.trump will easily win west virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether democrats remain loyal to their party or break for pritt. that’s why cole’s campaign is attacking justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” whether those voters go to cole or to pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for justice.in his attacks on justice, cole spokesman gates repeated one line a couple of times: “at the end of the day, jim justice is going to do what’s best for jim justice.”that line has been used about donald trump, too. the question for west virginia voters on election day will be whether what’s in justice and trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.mason adams writes from southwest virginia. he's on twitter at

1	if i hadn’t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, i’d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on monday night. it was hillary clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of donald trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.so what’s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? it has to do with trump’s not failing badly. he did not show himself to be “unfit” for the presidency, which was clinton’s main accusation against him. in the countless other occasions—from his announcement speech on—the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that trump’s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. his supporters—and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought—do not hear him the way those of us who’ve covered campaigns do. the insults, the sneers? that just shows he’s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. and what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on monday night)? it doesn’t matter, because he’s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.story continued belowif he’s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that’s a sign that he’s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again monday night.measured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is “unfit” for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional republicans have argued? clinton did bring up the 50 gop national security experts who have rejected him, but trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.and what of other standard measure? atmospherics? she was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle marco rubio impersonation. demeanor? it’s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.on the respective vulnerabilities? he launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then … the issue went away. by contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the “birther” issue, which he linked to outright racism. and his “defenses”—that he ”took advantage of the laws of the nation” in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes—were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. it’s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that “the people that are most affected by what's happening are african-american and hispanic people. and it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.”moreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out “racist:’ charging he’d “stiffed” many of those who’d worked for him. (she managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for trump.)finally, at the very end of the debate, moderator lester holt confronted trump with his statement that clinton did not have the “look” of a president—a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. when trump tried to shift the ground to a question of “stamina,” a smiling clinton was ready.“well,” she said, “as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.”that worked very well. i have little doubt that clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. but if this campaign so far has proven anything, it’s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. and i’m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.jeff greenfield is a five-time emmy-winning network television analyst and author.

"and in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the united states, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement."story continued belowpence said that police officers are "the best of us.""we ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias," he said, calling such assertions "rhetoric of division."asked by bishop john brannon, who is african-american, what pence would "personally do" to heal divides in the country, pence brought up the recent shootings."when there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld," pence said.pence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that "there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us."at a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, pence used the same line — that there is too much talk of "institutional racism" — to take aim at democratic nominee hillary clinton."but in the wake of these tragic events in tulsa and charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement," pence said. "we heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country."pence said people expect a "thorough, immediate and transparent investigation" in the wake of police shootings.pence went on to say that police are "not a force for racism in america, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect."he also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added "there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property."trump expressed his own concern about the tulsa shooting on wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was “choking” under pressure.authors:
1	we’ve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the syrian civil war. perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. he is clearly in shock. it shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: donald trump jr. the donald’s mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. after all, he made a disgusting holocaust reference when trying to tear down the media’s coverage of hillary clinton, saying if the gop did what the democrats are doing, they’d be “warming up the gas chamber.” well, now, he’s gone into the gutter again, this time regarding syrian refugees. trump jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of skittles:this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fhwog7ssn — donald trump jr.

1	a 22-year-old muslim man from afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. the worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.the uk’s express reports:jama b., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in boostedt, schleswig-holstein.the toddler, from iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in march this year. the court heard the afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.during the trial jama b. boasted: “i’m a superstar in afghanistan, a singer.”…judge stefan becker refused to comment on the verdict but peter boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.“therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. i have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. he’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.a second man, sohrab s., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. he was acquitted for lack of evidence.prosecutor axel bieler said, “rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. we do not assume this was the case.“therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. the penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.”say what? how about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? what kind of mind does axel bieler have? i can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.karin witt is not better. the spokeswoman of the kiel court said, “the court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.“the fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “he is young, knows no german and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. the victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.”what’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney.“it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” peter boysen said. “therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. i have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. he’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.really, mr. boysen? how about if this was your little boy? would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? i think not.germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.“the incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the bild am sonntag newspaper. “this is the verdict that shames you all.”people continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. allowing the foreign god of islam in what was once a christian country is problematic enough. excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.don’t think it won’t be happening in the united states either. our own military kicked out sgt. charles martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? i think not.in a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com

1	2.1k shares facebook twitterfor the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across charlotte. the riots are in response to the police shooting of keith lamont scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book.as usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. there was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.as it turns out, scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. as bearing arms reported:rakeyia scott’s cry to cmpd officers that her husband, keith lamont scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to rakeyia scott. on oct. 5, a gaston county district court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. the court order told scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. he was not allowed near their gastonia apartment they’d called home since april 2014, according to court documents. he was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. eleven days later, rakeyia scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “he is no longer a threat to me and my family.” but three days before she got the order, keith scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “he said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. she said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from april 2004 to april 2011. she checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.the scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. yeah – ok.scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed. while rioters destroy charlotte, they’re doing so over a man who could’ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would’ve been an accomplice to their murders.
1	donald trump constantly talks about how he’ll “make america great again.” he’ll bring jobs back, put america first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the republican nominee in the first place. however, there’s one thing trump can do to help americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the united states of america.well, since trump won’t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the american public on his own campaign website, hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. she calls it “a buyer’s guide for donald trump.” while donald trump says that “it’s very hard to have apparel made in this country,” or “they don’t even make the stuff here. it’s so hard to get.” hillary proves him wrong right away. here is a handy map of where trump can get all of his things made, right here in america, courtesy of hillaryclinton.com:hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. for instance, here’s all the places trump can make ties:instead, he makes them in china. and that is just one example. go to hillary’s website for a full list. in other words, trump’s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-american business practices. if trump wants to bring jobs back to america, he can start with his own companies.thanks for the handy guide, hillary! no doubt trump will never read it.featured image via sara d. davis/getty images

1	55.6k shares share this storyonce again, donald trump and the republican party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in chelsea, new york city, trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying syrian refugees. “these attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on september 19th.he later went on fox news and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “think of it, hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. it’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.”in fact, mr. trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized american citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a sikh immigrant, harinder bains. he is the owner of the bar in whose doorway ahmad rahami decided to take a nap in. when bains saw the man’s face on cnn, he did what any responsible citizen would do.he called the cops.“i did what i think every american would have done. my neighbor would have done the same thing. any jewish, christian, sikh, muslim. anybody would have done the same thing…i’m from sikh faith. i’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said bains to cnn’s chris cuomo.he’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. all of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on syrian refugees because they’re muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the syrian civil war. none of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the united states.the chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. mr. bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. when immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.for instance, the orlando shooter was reported to the fbi by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of mateen’s radicalization; racist trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. mr. trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. he is the real threat to america – not refugee or immigrants.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

1	rep. peter king: we shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctnessnew york rep. peter king rejected former secretary of state hillary clinton’s focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with american muslims. instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community.“i disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,” king said on msnbc shortly after clinton answered questions from the press on the weekend’s bombing in manhattan.story continued belowking is not new to this topic. his insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within islam drew comparisons to sen. joseph mccarthy’s infamous communist witch hunt. (king has said he considers such attacks on him a "badge of honor.") as she has before, clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart isil’s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith.but the only way to gather such intelligence, king said, is to step up surveillance.“so listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring muslim americans outside,” king said. “to get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. that’s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the westies and the irish, whether it’s the italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. we shouldn't be pandering to political correctness."authors:
1	ahmad khan rahami is pictured in an undated photo provided by the fbi. | ap photo 28-year-old man sought in manhattan blastnew york — police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning monday in bombings that rocked a manhattan neighborhood and a new jersey shore town, and new york's governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection.ahmad khan rahami, a naturalized u.s. citizen from afghanistan with an address in elizabeth, new jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, new york city mayor bill de blasio said in one of a series of tv appearances just minutes after the photo was released.story continued belowin addition to the blast in manhattan's chelsea neighborhood on saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a new jersey shore town before a charity 5k race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in chelsea. on sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an elizabeth train station.new jersey state police said monday, citing the fbi, that the bombings in chelsea and the new jersey shore town seaside park were connected. no one was injured in the jersey blast.new york gov. andrew cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were "certain commonalities among the bombs," leading authorities to believe "that there was a common group behind the bombs.""we want to get this guy in for questioning," de blasio said on cnn. "we need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... i think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. things are moving very quickly."early monday, fbi agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth that's tied to rahami. the activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. no one was injured.saturday night's blast in the bustling chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. in the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de blasio and cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. both said monday that appears to be changing."the more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism," de blasio said in a later interview on ny1 news.cuomo, in a separate interview on msnbc, said: "today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... my operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this."the white house said president barack obama was briefed throughout the night and early monday on the investigation into bombs found in new york city and new jersey. spokesman josh earnest said obama will comment publicly later monday.on sunday night, fbi agents in brooklyn stopped "a vehicle of interest" in the investigation of the manhattan explosion, according to fbi spokeswoman kelly langmesser.she wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told the associated press that five people in the car were being questioned at an fbi building in manhattan.the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.no one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, langmesser said.cuomo, touring the site of saturday's blast in chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared "similar in design" to the bomb that exploded in chelsea.on sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the chelsea bomb contained a residue of tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. the discovery of tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two new york city devices and the pipe bomb at the jersey shore are connected.cellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no tannerite residue was identified in the new jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity.the pipe bomb exploded saturday in seaside park, new jersey, before a charity 5k race to benefit marines and sailors. the race was canceled and no one was injured.the bombings in new york city and new jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. the st. cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to allah and asked a victim if he or she was muslim before attacking. the islamic state group has claimed responsibility.authors:
1	24.8k shares share this storyrepublican nominee donald trump’s ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in america really is when kathy miller told reporters that racism in america didn’t exist until president obama. “i don’t think there was any racism until obama got elected. we never had problems like this … now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and i think that’s the philosophy that obama has perpetuated on america. growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. we were just all kids going to school.”this perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the african-american community, she then went on to say that black americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. you’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. you’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. you had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. it’s not our fault, certainly.”to put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the black lives matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black americans “were raised.”in one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the jim crow era, the widespread lynchings of black americans by radical christian terrorist organizations like the ku klux klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the war on drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black americans by law enforcement from the record. instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.she is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the american population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. when the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “i don’t care, it’s the truth.”the trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.update: kathy miller has resigned her from her position with the trump campaign and has issued an apology. it should be noted the trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40:add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

1	when hillary clinton attacked donald trump for not releasing his tax returns and allegedly paying zero in federal income taxes, the republican presidential nominee had just four words to say in response.“that makes me smart,” trump said from the debate stage at hofstra university tonight.he has said repeatedly he is being audited by the irs and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. but during the first general-election presidential debate, in hempstead, new york, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns “against my lawyer’s wishes” if clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.“as soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,” trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, “i will release my tax returns.”the white house hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with clinton accusing trump of proposing the “most extreme version” of “trickle-down economics.”“the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we’ve ever had,” the democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. “i call it trumped-up trickle-down because that’s exactly what it would be. that is not how we grow the economy.”before trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, clinton took another jab.“donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,” she continued. “he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. i don't buy that.”trump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.meanwhile, clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.trump fired back, blaming “politicians like secretary clinton” for plunging the nation into debt.“we’re a debtor nation,” he said. “we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. and we don’t have the money because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.”clinton suggested that trump’s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. but trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste.“it would be squandered too, believe me,” he said.abc news' nicole phillip, maggie mcnish and sunny choo contributed to this report.

1	early voting has begun in the battleground state of north carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing democrats with an eight point advantage over republicans.data analysis from targetsmart (who partnered with nbc news) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered democrats, 34 percent from republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from libertarians.contrast that to 2012, when mitt romney won north carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, republicans held a five percent lead. now democrats hold an eight percent lead. in 2008, when president obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), democrats had an 11 point advantage. in 2004, democrats had an 11 point advantage, but kerry lost to bush by 13 percent.so while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.nate silver’s fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton a 43 percent chance of winning north carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for democrats in early voting. the new york times’ election model gives clinton a 48 percent chance of winning north carolina.again, no wonder governor pat mccory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the gop legislature wanted to do away with it. when democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in november.democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. although early voting points to a democratic-leaning result, republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on november 8. president obama never overcame romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of september favored obama.with 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for november 8.rachel maddow broke down the facts on her show:featured image via justin sullivan/getty images

1	uk begins construction on “great wall” – meant to keep illegal migrants out (video)the united kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at calais, france. the wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the english channel. the wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.there is a nearby migrant camp called “the jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the united kingdom. the wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences.× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy nowthe “jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. police have called that area of calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. the migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. they have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.it is these attacks that encouraged calais port chief executive jean-marc puissesseau to support the wall. “this wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “we can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.”liberals in the united kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of donald trump. however, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. thankfully, the british government, along with the french, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue.
1	kallstadt, germany — few places in germany are as representative of the country’s heartland as kallstadt, the village in which u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump’s grandfather was born — and from which he was later deported.the hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of frankfurt. it has one bakery and one butcher. every year, kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.trump may have captured a large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. and yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.in fact, few politicians are less popular in germany than trump. a study by the pew research center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.since a local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger, a member of the german parliament, was distantly related to trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “with his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton, trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” steiniger tells politico.trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt. “he stands for everything that’s bad,” says sarah bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.this year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: saumagen-döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a turkish kebab. “everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says bühler. “pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”tanja huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. since the prospect of a trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “they don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about trump,” says huber. “he’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”* * *donald’s grandfather, friedrich trump, was born in kallstadt into a vintner’s family on march 14, 1869. previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “trump,” “dromb” and “trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by gwenda blair; but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on “trump.”germany did not yet exist as a nation; kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom. the region was going though rough times. unemployment was high. those who had the courage, left.friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. at 16 years old, friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina, who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier. he arrived in new york on board the eider on october 19, 1885.he entered the u.s. through official channels, but he had left bavaria illegally. “both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said roland paul, the recently-retired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern.according to documents uncovered by paul, friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the u.s.but friedrich was not done with palatinate. seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by blair. five years after that, he returned once more to kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old elisabeth christ; they were engaged, and friedrich came back a third time to marry her in august 1902.but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had a daughter, friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the u.s. and return to the land of their birth. “my grandmother said, i will marry you, but i will not go back to america with you,” donald trump’s american-born cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in 2012.friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. in 1904, he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt. and although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the united states within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the u.s. with him, according to blair’s family history.back in kallstadt, friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. but though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. on february 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was “to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may 1 of this year, at the latest.”friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. but eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july 1, 1905, and return to new york. shortly after that, donald’s father, fred trump junior, was born.“[the authorities] said, ‘you are not a german citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says walter. “so they left and they went back to america, and that’s why donald and i are here.”friedrich — now named frederick — died in may 1918 of the spanish flu. his widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited kallstadt many times during her life.* * *in february 2012, simone wendel, the german filmmaker from kallstadt, was given an audience with donald trump. roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “kings of kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: donald trump and henry john heinz, the inventor of heinz ketchup.for months, wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. she was only able to secure a visit with the help of walter, trump’s cousin, who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.on the day of her visit, wendel stood nervously next to walter in a conference room on one of trump tower’s top floors. she had brought a linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. but when she asked trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “his assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.“hello, john,” trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking new york’s central park. wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “afterwards, i just kept on thinking, ‘what on earth did i do?’” she says.“the cake looks really good,” trump said, and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.until 1990, trump still claimed his family was swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-german sentiment in the u.s. during the two world wars. but by the time wendel visited, he had become proud of his german roots. “they grow them well in kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “they grow them very well. believe me. it’s good stock.”“wow, it’s beautiful,” trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “that’s fantastic. see how well-maintained it is? everything is perfectly maintained. it’s great.”when their interview was over, walter took wendel on a tour of trump tower. on one of the floors, they ran into trump’s son, eric trump.“have you ever heard the word kallstadt?” wendel asked him.“kallstadt?” trump junior replied, “no, what is it?”

1	as donald trump courted african-american voters in cleveland on wednesday at a town hall taped by fox news to air thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level.when asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, trump responded, "i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york. it worked incredibly well. and you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."he added, "new york city was incredible, the way that worked, so i think that could be one step you could do."the law enforcement policy — in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations — has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. the policy gained prominence in the 1990s under new york city police commissioner bill bratton and mayor rudy giuliani, who is now a close confidant of trump's.trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising giuliani for its success in new york. trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.he has drawn the ire of some african-americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.on tuesday night, trump said, "our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever" — seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.on thursday morning, however, in an interview on "fox & friends," he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally."now chicago is out of control. i was referring to chicago with stop and frisk," trump said.his initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention chicago, though trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is "out of control."of course, as president, trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement.during a press conference, the members of the congressional black caucus were asked about trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. "the notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in new york is ludicrous, and donald trump needs to check his facts," said rep. hakeem jeffries, d-new york."we would ask donald trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional," said rep. yvette clarke, d-new york.

1	kiss’ gene simmons: “you want to win the war on terror? profile everyone, profile me!” [video]it has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the war on terror. while during george w. bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on american soil. but since barack obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. there have been shootings and bombings… and yet obama is refusing to change anything. after welcoming thousands of muslim refugees from syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the united states next year. they have to be muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! well, according to obama and his fellow liberals, anyway.but that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to kiss front man gene simmons. according to him, if we want to win the war on terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him!check out the video below:× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy now“everyone needs to get smart. i’m okay with profiling,” simmons declared. “i want you to stop me first. i want you to stop me because i look a certain way. and if i’m clear, than profile someone else. it’s emergency powers during war. there’s a war going on.”but it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. simmons had a response to that, too. “it is unfair,” he said. “that’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.”it’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” but being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. profiling does — just look at israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. somehow, profiling works well for them.muslims are not all terrorists. we know that. but most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, muslims. there is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like isis. if they don’t, then what’s the problem?liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to second amendment rights. they’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. yet profiling is completely unacceptable? get real, liberals. you make no sense.
1	john kerry says washington cannot be successful alone. | ap photo kerry says syrian diplomacy at impasse after truce collapsesnew york — the united states and russia ended any pretenses thursday of their cease-fire for syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in aleppo."we can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't," secretary of state john kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from russia and more than a dozen european and middle eastern countries.story continued belowkerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. instead, kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low.no one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. while kerry and lavrov were set to hold more talks friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point.as the diplomats huddled in a new york hotel, syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months.according to one official present in the gathering, kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his blackberry. a furious kerry then told the entire room, lavrov included, that "even while we are meeting here, they are doing this," said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.lavrov told russian media that consultations would continue to "guarantee" the cease-fire.but even as kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between syrian president bashar assad's russian-backed government and u.s.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working."we can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open," kerry told reporters. "russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance."he called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a russian one earlier this week that the u.s. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck."absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached," kerry said, describing a "moment of truth" for syria, russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed.the meeting came after assad told the ap in an interview in damascus that the united states was to blame for the deal's failure. he cited u.s. inability to control "terrorist" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of syrian soldiers. the u.s. apologized for what it described as a mistake.lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire.but u.s. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the syrian and russian military's could violate the agreement.authors:

1	new york (cnn) hillary clinton and donald trump both met with world leaders in town for the united nations general assembly on monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.both clinton and trump met with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.clinton, who served for four years as president barack obama's secretary of state, also met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and ukrainian president petro poroshenko.while the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next monday.trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. the key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader."i will say that with all the folks being in new york, i've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that i'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet," trump said monday on fox news. "i don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over."he later said, "i've already met with a couple," but refused to say which ones.clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct us foreign policy as president.clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. clinton touched on north korea and the rise of china with japan's abe, while clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with egypt while she met with sisi.while reporters were in the room, clinton told sisi that she looked forward to talking about the "path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."trump also met with sisi on monday evening in new york where the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt," according to a trump campaign statement after the meeting.sen. jeff sessions of alabama and lt. gen. michael flynn (ret.), two of trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined trump for the meeting."mr. trump expressed to president el-sisi his strong support for egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a trump administration, the united states of america will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead," the trump campaign said.the republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the muslim world for his proposal to ban muslims from the u.s. and his blanket statements about islam, also shared his "high regard for peace-loving muslims," the campaign added.the campaign also said trump called the us-egypt relationship "vital to help promote peace and stability in the middle east."sisi is the second foreign leader trump has met with since becoming the republican nominee. he first met with the mexican president in mexico last month.sitting with poroshenko, clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces, primarily "the very real problems and threats from russian aggression." clinton added that she was "anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."clinton's meetings were announced before trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the white house."if she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on day one," said a senior clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. "while she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins."the meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for trump given clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet mexican president enrique peña nieto earlier this year.the meeting ended awkwardly after trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but peña nieto said he told trump during the meeting that mexico would not pay for it.clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the mexican leader and trump, with the democratic nominee calling it trump's "embarrassing international incident.""when you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, i think the answer is clear: donald trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief," clinton told voters in ohio after the meeting.for her part, clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.clinton's meeting with poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the democratic and republican nominee on policy toward moscow. clinton's campaign and other democrats have accused trump of cozying up to putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting us goals and failing to confront moscow over its annexation of crimea in ukraine.clinton's adviser said that she believed that washington needed to do more to stand up to russian "aggression" in ukraine and to allow the kiev government to defend itself.currently, the obama administration has offered logistical help to ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some republicans have championed. the official did not say, however, whether clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the ukrainians.clinton's meeting with sisi will make waves in the middle east because of the recent estrangement between the egyptian president's government and the obama administration.clinton, according to an aide in the room, "emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to egypt's future progress" and "discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against isis."clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of us citizen aya hijazi, who has been imprisoned in egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards egypt. but nevertheless, the official said, clinton does understand the complexity and complications of us relations with egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the middle east, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at israeli-palestinian peace.sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected muslim brotherhood government in egypt in 2013. clinton had been secretary of state when the us helped push egypt's longtime strongman hosni mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing us ally."there are a lot of things that the sisi government is doing that are concerning," the official said.trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on egypt, are more opaque than those of clinton. but in his terrorism speech in august, he vowed to work with leaders in the middle east -- including sisi -- who "recognize that this ideology of death" must be extinguished.clinton's meeting with abe comes at a time of increased tensions in asia following north korea's latest nuclear weapons test. the meeting will likely highlight clinton's commitment to us alliances in japan and south korea and the us belief that it is up to china to do more to convince its ally in pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.clinton, according to an aide, discussed "the threat from north korea" and "relations with china" during the meeting. and abe brought up the trans-pacific partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the japanese prime minister has backed and clinton has rejected.there is significant concern among us allies the region about the prospect of a trump presidency -- not least because the gop nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep us forces in their countries and raised the possibility that pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.
1	washington since we last updated the cnn battleground map, donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. the republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.and, yet, hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook. when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.hear cnn political director david chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:what's changed?-- iowa (6) moves from from "battleground" to "lean republican"-- utah (6) moves from "lean republican" to "solid republican"-- maine's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid democrat" to "battleground"-- nebraska's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid republican" to "battleground"road to 270: electoral college mapnote: the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.the state of playdonald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa (a state barack obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up "battleground" category into the "lean republican" category, giving trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.that leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- florida, nevada, ohio, and north carolina.maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. both maine and nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. maine's second congressional district has moved from "solid democrat" to "battleground" and nebraska's second congressional district has moved from "solid republican" to "battleground," providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.finally, utah moves back from "leaning republican" to being solidly being in trump's column.there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.for all of the endless talk about florida, ohio and north carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. pennsylvania, colorado, michigan, and virginia are the core of clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest a more viable path for trump.it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. he still needs to chip away at clinton's democratic leaning firewall.that's why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania, for example. and that's why clinton and pro-clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from trump and pro-trump forces. in fact, pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only florida and ohio.clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans, but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, clinton's electoral college advantage holds.solid republican:alabama (9), alaska (3), arkansas (6), idaho (4), indiana (11), kansas (6), kentucky (8), louisiana (8), mississippi (6),

1	(cnn) north korea went on the offensive friday, blasting the us for "aggression" in asia, blaming washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the us with "tremendous consequences beyond imagination."the democratic people's republic of korea "had no other choice but to go nuclear," foreign minister ri yong ho told the un general assembly, to defend itself "from the constant nuclear threats from the united states."ri's comments came as the us and asian nations gathered in new york friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: north korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet.the test tuesday was followed by a us show of force, as the pentagon on wednesday flew two b-1b bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea, setting the the stage for us-south korea joint military exercises in october that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike.the heightened tensions, north korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the pentagon on notice."north korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland," gen. joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said wednesday in maryland. "it's consumed an awful lot of time -- i think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks."the north korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. "only a couple of days ago, the united states has again threatened the dprk by flying the strategic bombers 'b-1b' over the military demarcation line on the korean peninsula and landing in south korea," ri said. "we will never remain onlookers at it and the united states will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination."meanwhile, secretary of state john kerry met friday on the sidelines of the un general assembly with foreign ministers from the association of southeast asian nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation."the united states will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies," kerry told the asean meeting.he called on allies to "vigorously" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged asean members to "ensure that the dprk pays a price for its dangerous actions."japanese prime minister shinzo abe made a blunt call for international action at the un wednesday. "right before our eyes, north korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt," abe said. "there is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now."the perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals japan and south korea closer together. it's putting china on the spot as washington pushes beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the south china sea complicate cooperation. and it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force iran to the negotiating table.that's still unlikely to stop north korea, formally known as the democratic people's republic of korea, experts said. indeed, us officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early october."from north korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the us," said alison evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm ihs."for north korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. it needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized," evans said, adding that, "the leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival."us officials say the pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. meanwhile, the union of concerned scientists said there is some speculation that pyongyang may try another satellite launch around october 10, the anniversary of the founding of its worker's party of korea.north korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in january. in the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches.in may, north korea's 32-year-old leader kim jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy.just watched us b-1 bombers fly over south korea replay more videos ... must watch us b-1 bombers fly over south korea 02:52pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on september 9, the anniversary of the dprk's founding in 1948.and tuesday's rocket launch was "substantially larger and more powerful than anything north korea has tested before," according to 38 north, a program devoted to analyzing north korea at johns hopkins university's school of advanced international studies.all this testing is unlikely to win it the us recognition it craves, though.after the more recent nuclear test, president barack obama made clear that "the united states does not, and never will, accept north korea as a nuclear state."obama said that the us would work with asian allies, the un security council and international partners to implement existing measures and "take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to north korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions."however, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that obama administration will soon no longer calling the american shots on the issue.republican presidential nominee donald trump has held out the possibility of meeting with kim in a dramatic break with us political conventions. he earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that south korea and japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons."at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea," trump told anderson cooper at a cnn town hall in milwaukee in march. "we're better off, frankly, if south korea is going to start to protect itself."the statements have rattled tokyo and seoul, and while trump has said that china must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with beijing on trade could also roil that effort.the republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding american policy in the region and is likely to be something that us officials are asked to address in their consultations friday.photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills south korean and u.s. troops staged an amphibious assault saturday, march 12 as u.s. and south korean military units embarked on eight weeks of annual joint military exercises. hide caption 1 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills clouds of camouflage smoke obscure amphibious assault vehicles coming into shore as part of military exercises on march 12. south korea's defense ministry spokesman is calling the maneuvers "the largest scale ever," involving 300,000 south korean soldiers and at least 17,000 from the u.s. hide caption 2 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills a south korean marine looks through a viewfinder on a sniper rifle on march 12. marines and sailors stormed a beach aboard assault vehicles in a mock amphibious assault. hide caption 3 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills a south korean marine looks through his rifle's view finder on march 12 with an amphibious assault vehicle in the background. hide caption 4 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills a south korea marine holds an assault rifle in the march 12 exercises. hide caption 5 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills small detachments of forces from australia and new zealand also participated in saturday's maneuvers. hide caption 6 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills south korean marines group crouch between two amphibious assault vehicles during the march 12th drill. hide caption 7 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills south korean marines points their weapons during the joint military exercises held on march 12. hide caption 8 of 9 photos: south korea, u.s. hold 'largest ever' drills protesters call for a more peaceful atmosphere on the korean peninsula as south korea and u.s. troops hold joint military exercises on march 12. hide caption 9 of 9hillary clinton has also articulated a strong stance on china, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the asian power. on north korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up us sanctions.international sanctions levied in march after the january nuclear test were the first on north korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. they ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps.the international community could squeeze north korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said bruce klingner, a senior research fellow at the heritage foundation, echoing the way un sanctions targeted iran by banning the export of its oil."that is a big step," klingner said, "it will impact the people of north korea."just watched general: us held 'nuclear hostage' by north korea replay more videos ... must watch general: us held 'nuclear hostage' by north korea 02:16china signed on for the march sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say china historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against north korea. us tensions with china over the south china sea could make it harder to cooperate.dunford said wednesday that "china seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the pacific."the us can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on pyongyang, klingner said, by sanctioning non-north korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely chinese entities and financial institutions.in the meantime, us military officials are planning.from october 3 to 21, the us and south korea will carry out the joint exercise "red flag" in alaska, which will include an aerial exercise "simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack," a ministry spokesperson with the south korean defense department told cnn.north korea derided south korea as a "puppet warmongers" in a statement about the red flag exercises.
1	never has the “rights for me, but not for thee” idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control. politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren.they talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles – especially the black ones – serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. the only kind of gun they don’t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it’s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time.while these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards. yes, armed with evil guns. donald trump brought this up at a campaign rally in miami, florida. he said:“she’s very much against the second amendment. she wants to destroy your second amendment. guns, guns, guns, right? i think what we should do is – she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. i think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. they should disarm, right? right? i think they should disarm immediately. what do you think? yes? take their guns away! she doesn’t want guns. let’s see what happens to her. it would be very dangerous.”every gun control politician benefits from the second amendment. the high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. they know that having armed security around them protects them. but they don’t want everyday americans to be afforded the same right.for now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they’d be okay if americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com

1	as my 25th wedding anniversary approached, i tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. i had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. i went to a local coin shop, and as i idled over some of the display cases, i noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.“oh, the panic of 1857,” the owner said when i asked him about the change of size. “it was really bad. the president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”story continued belownow that is inept presidential decision-making. during the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. and before the current candidates were known, the two most recent white house occupants, barack obama and george w. bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.but obama and bush can both take heart. and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. by my reckoning, that place belongs to james buchanan, genial a man though he was. i’ve made quite a study of him. my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of franklin pierce. everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. if i were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about washington or lincoln, or even silent cal coolidge. it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.buchanan, the only president from my native state, pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of america’s great financial downturns.for a long time before buchanan, in effect, precipitated the panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. there had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in europe, the dissolution of the bank of the united states, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and western land. the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk, from oregon to california to texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states. manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent.then the day before buchanan took office, congress passed what he wanted, the tariff bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the dred scott supreme court decision, which fell on the shoulders of buchanan. the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but roger taney, the supreme court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with buchanan, of small dickinson college, wanted it settled.scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri, a slave state, but in the northwest territories, which were nonslave. after his master died, scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good.buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five southerners and four northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. he and taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the appeals court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier, another dickinson alumnus and a justice from pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which taney would write. eventually, a new york native, justice samuel nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.legend has it that taney, on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.two days later, the decision came down. taney castigated scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the fugitive slave law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.historically, experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just taney, but surely buchanan, responsible for it.as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. by midsummer, no one could take a ride on the reading, as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game, since the reading railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central. several lines, like the delaware, lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. senator william seward, the leader of the new republican party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the illinois central, promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas, was virtually worthless.every bank in new york city effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. the oldest grain company in new york, n.h. wolfe and co., failed in august, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the ohio life insurance and trust co.buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.the residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by dred scott. instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement, as buchanan had thought, dred scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of northern prosperity.yet the south did not succumb as badly. its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in europe. there was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions. the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being a southern lackey.buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. he said the federal government could do nothing. in his annual message in december 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.in a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. when hostilities flared in kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical john brown. when later brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in harpers ferry, west virginia, just 40 miles from washington along the potomac, buchanan again diddled before consulting robert e. lee, who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas. lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid.in other ventures, though, buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. he caused chaos in utah, quelling what he thought to be a mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. he supported mercenary william walker’s forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. then there was the little known pig war, started when a settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest, shot a pig owned by the hudson bay co. that wandered onto his property. a standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. this was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the u.s. army, stretched as thin as could be.as the election of 1860 came close, buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win, stephen douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. that caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election.the southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between lincoln’s election and his inauguration in march, thus under buchanan’s watch. buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.as the first half-dozen states seceded, buchanan lost several cabinet members—he had a lot of southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former president john tyler, who would himself become a confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.meanwhile, buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south, fort sumter.enter lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but i contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan, the “worst. president. ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for abe lincoln to climb.today, george w. bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of ’08 and the beginning of the great recession. obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a president hillary clinton or a president donald trump to shine.robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst. president. ever.: james buchanan, the potus rating game, and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents.
1	nate smith, executive director of the texas nationalist movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to smith’s struggle for an independent texas. standing in a conference room in the ritz hotel in central moscow on sunday, smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.it wasn’t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the ritz at what has been dubbed moscow’s international conference of separatists, an eclectic kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, catalonian separatists and dissident irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east ukrainian rebels, azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed "king of hawaii," who called in via video link.and among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two americans campaigning for texan and californian secession from the united states.the conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the kremlin and organized by the anti-globalization movement of russia, a group that closely follows government positions. the movement says it is unconnected to the kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by president vladimir putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. the attendees, including the texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.the conference’s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with kremlin efforts to promote russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged american imperialism.“our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,” the conference’s creator, aleksander v. ionov, told its participants. “our president, vladimir vladimirovich putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.”ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met syrian president bashar al-assad, whom russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.ionov’s conference plays into moscow’s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former soviet neighbors. while jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern ukraine. a sizable presence of pro-russian rebel supporters was visible on sunday, while not a single russian separatist group took part.all that and the anti-american flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the kremlin’s orbit.“it’s kind of awkward i guess,” smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of american inequity.abc newssmith’s group, the texas nationalist movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether texas should exit the united states. founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the texas state gop to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the republican convention. smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the kremlin.“we’re here to have a dialogue. we’re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,” smith said. “we’re here for very specific reasons. we came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of texas.”it was a sentiment echoed by louis j. marinelli from the yes california independence campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the golden state a nation.“we want to draw attention to our campaign,” marinelli said. “we’re not signing an alliance with russia or anything like that."the two secessionists’ urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with american foreign policy and a sense the u.s. has become dysfunctional. a gentle-mannered it consultant married to a russian, marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.“the u.s. government is so dysfunctional it can’t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for californians,” marinelli said.both men were hoping for a donald trump victory in the u.s. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from america. the u.k.'s recent "brexit" vote to leave the european union had also heartened many attendees.but why exactly the kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. nor did they appear particularly interested.“i’m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,” smith said.however, the conference -- and its location in one of moscow’s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent russian strategy. russia has been backing far right political parties in the west, in particular, reportedly funding france’s anti-european union party, the front national, with a $10 million loan. the practice echoes that of the soviet union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.“it’s a school-book case,” said peter kreko, a fulbright visiting professor at indiana university who has studied russia’s use of the far right. “the simple reason is that russia is interested in dividing the western world. the strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.”kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering european integration and to undermine faith in western-style liberal democracy.“the tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the soviet union. any kind of movements that can cause chaos,” kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint russia as a champion of democracy.few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.“everybody’s using everybody,” marinelli said. “we’re using this conference for our own purposes. we want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..." he trailed off before finishing. “everybody’s got their own agenda, right? so, that’s just the way it is.”for most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference’s oddity.“i’ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. i've got to get my story out,” said diarmuid mac dubhglais, international secretary for republican sinn féin, a tiny irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of british control over northern ireland.in any case, mac dubhglais said, he wouldn’t let “vladimir himself” impose ideas on him.“i’m not going to start passing out propaganda when i go home and start marching soviet-style," he said.besides, he said, perhaps the russian motive was altruistic. “maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,” he said then paused, before adding: “i’m hoping that’s what they think."
1	president barack obama has never had a great relationship with saudi arabia.now, he’s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.story continued belowobama has cast the saudis as "so-called" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich arab state learn to "share" the middle east with rival iran. the saudis, meanwhile, consider obama naive, sparring with him over the iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to syria’s bloody civil war.despite these differences, obama has promised to veto a bill that congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.that obama and riyadh find themselves on the same side against congress underscores the bizarre evolution of u.s.-saudi ties over the past eight years. an alliance once unquestioned in washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards."this is clearly a relationship in transition," said jon alterman, an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies. "nobody really has a sense of what they’re trying to transition it to."just how tricky is the relationship? two more examples: obama is supporting the saudis in their fight against iran-backed rebels in yemen, even though u.s. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the islamic state. and many of the same u.s. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. "does no one sense the irony?” asked republican sen. rand paul of kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the senate.the back and forth in washington is "schizophrenic behavior" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the middle east for years, said a former senior u.s. official deeply familiar with the arab world.congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the sept. 11 attacks. the saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major pr effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. the saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the u.s. has never found proof of it, either. the saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in u.s. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.administration officials downplay the idea that obama will veto the bill merely to protect saudi arabia. normally, u.s. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the u.s. to be sued over its actions abroad."to pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even american businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish," white house spokesman josh earnest said in a recent press briefing.the perception in many quarters, however, is that obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. fifteen of the 19 hijackers on sept. 11, 2001, were saudi nationals. and the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about saudi government ties to islamist extremists."we are disappointed that the president is not standing with us," said mindy kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers thursday to push for a veto override. "we have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability."whatever his motivation, obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease saudi suspicions.the saudis' wariness of obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in riyadh as a so-called ally. it grew after obama sided against egyptian strongman hosni mubarak during the 2011 arab spring movements, leading saudi royals to question whether america would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.it deepened in 2013, after obama decided not to stage a military strike against syrian president bashar assad, who is despised by the saudis, even after assad apparently crossed obama's "red line" by using chemical weapons. and it reached a new peak in 2015 after obama struck a nuclear deal with iran, a shiite theocracy that sunni-majority saudi arabia views as a growing threat in the middle east.still, obama, cognizant of the need for the u.s. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the middle east, has otherwise tried hard to allay saudi concerns. he cut short a trip to india to rush to see the newly crowned saudi king, salman, in january 2015, after the previous monarch died. he also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the saudis, in part to assuage saudi concerns about the iran nuclear deal.but earlier this year, in comments to the atlantic magazine that infuriated the saudis, obama appeared to reverse decades of u.s. policy that tilted heavily toward riyadh and against tehran.“the competition between the saudis and the iranians — which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in syria and iraq and yemen — requires us to say to our friends as well as to the iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” obama said.prince turki al-faisal, the former head of saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that obama had "thrown us a curve ball" and criticizing the president for saying america’s gulf allies were “free riders” wholly dependent on the u.s. for their security.and in april, weeks after the atlantic piece was published, saudi arabia appeared to snub obama when he visited riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state tv. the readouts from those meetings in riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd "discussed" and "exchanged views" more than agreeing on anything.the president also hosted saudi arabia’s deputy crown prince, mohammed bin salman, when he visited washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdom’s image in washington. obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the saudi economy, dubbed vision 2030. he also tried to reassure the saudi royal that the u.s. will back the saudis against interference by iran, which remains an official enemy of the united states.but some constants in the u.s.-saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.the low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the u.s. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing america’s addiction to saudi oil. some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative saudi arabia — women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the internet and the outside world; and thousands of saudis educated in the u.s. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.by all accounts, the u.s. and saudi arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and u.s. officials privately say the saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as al qaeda, which the saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. u.s. officials also say the saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant."the close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the islamic state], the continued saudi preference for american arms, the important role that saudi arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future," said fahad nazer, a former political analyst with the saudi embassy in washington who now does similar work for jtg inc.in many ways, what obama thinks about the saudis matters less and less as his time in the oval office draws to an end. but while the saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.both democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump have voiced grave concerns about saudi arabia's track record of producing islamic extremists; clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. but while clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the saudis see trump — who has called for a ban on muslims entering the united states — as a wild card.for now, however, the saudis are nervously watching congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.already, some members of congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold obama's veto. their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the european union, voice opposition to the bill. the original bill passed on voice vote in both houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. and with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.“saudi arabia has never been an especially popular actor in washington — a powerful one, but not popular," the former senior u.s. official said. "and now, nobody in congress wants to stick their neck out for the saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.”authors:
1	"i would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter," sen. mitch mcconnell said. | getty mcconnell punts budget vote to buy time for dealsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over zika funding largely resolved.the key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. tuesday, mcconnell said — giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until dec. 9. for now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the zika virus while allowing planned parenthood’s partner clinic in puerto rico to access the federal grants — a provision that had been a major point of contention.story continued below“senate republicans stand ready to move forward,” mcconnell (r-ky.) said monday. “i would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.”mcconnell spent about five minutes huddling with senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) on monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.but the tentative resolution on zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. senate democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone zika bill over restrictions that barred planned parenthood — particularly profamilias, the health care provider’s partner in puerto rico — from the federal funds. but in the cr, the puerto rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion zika package, multiple sources said.language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that’s delayed zika aid for months.despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. in a brief interview monday morning, reid said “no” when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.“close is relative,” reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.for instance, funding for the water crisis in flint, michigan, continues to be in the mix. democrats on both ends of the capitol have lobbied for flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a senate water resources bill.but republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken louisiana in the short-term spending measure. both issues remained unresolved as of monday evening, although senior senate democrats suggested they wouldn’t accept flood aid without also getting money for flint. congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the zika funding package.“louisiana is not resolved because [republicans] want to do louisiana, we want to do flint,” sen. chuck schumer (d-n.y.) told reporters monday evening. “they don’t want to do flint.”another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the obama administration’s proposal to hand over the u.s. government’s authority over the internet domain system to an international body on oct. 1 — a push that’s being led by texas sen. ted cruz and a host of other republican lawmakers. if no deference is paid to cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among republicans — even with some pushback on the provision from democrats.“this is the coordination of the domain names. it’s not who has control of the internet,” florida sen. bill nelson, the top democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said monday. “and every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.”meanwhile, democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the export-import bank to finance projects greater than $10 million — which it hasn’t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank’s board are vacant. the ex-im issue is similarly toxic among republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.there are other items that could fill up the senate’s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the november elections. sens. chris murphy (d-conn.) and rand paul (r-ky.) plan to force a senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to saudi arabia that the obama administration announced last month.senate majority whip john cornyn (r-texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by president barack obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia.though obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until friday to do so.republicans — who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the senate in the balance — privately believe democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.heather caygle contributed to this report.authors:

1	in the first half of the debate, donald trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. after peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that hillary clinton is too sick to be commander-in-chief, one must ask themselves why trump couldn’t stop sniffling. is he sick? was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by clinton)?howard dean, former head of the dnc and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.dean, who is now a contributor for msnbc, tweeted last night:notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user? — howard dean (@govhowarddean) september 27, 2016trump supporters took to twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against clinton and her stamina abilities. but hey, get offended when dean points out what could be the obvious. after all, trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.and considering he hasn’t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.of course trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the republican nominee denies that he is sick. so that begs the question: what else could it be.dean’s assertion is just that — an assertion. it has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. perhaps they (and trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint clinton as anything she’s not.if this debate showed one thing, it’s that hillary came out on top and trump is not happy about it. why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? howard dean is.featured image via joe readle/getty images

1	on monday, donald trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami, who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city.this would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn’t been a contradiction of something trump had said just a few minutes before. fortunately, whenever trump flip-flops or lies, americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media – and they didn’t hesitate to remind trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahami’s capture, he’d dissed the nypd for allowing “political correctness” to interfere with catching terrorists. among the first to point this out was msnbc’s christopher hayes, who tweeted:hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment trump had made on fox and friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said:“you know, our police are amazing, our local police. they know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don’t want to be accused of profiling, and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things.”yup – trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:this tweet was particularly funny, and i’m sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with:throughout his presidential campaign, trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a “law and order” candidate. but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.featured image via spencer platt / getty images

1	ap photo mcconnell, pelosi, ryan seek deal on government funding impasse a total of $170 million for the flint water crisis is added to the wrda bill.speaker paul ryan, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house minority leader nancy pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.in a series of three-way discussions on tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until dec. 9. in turn, republicans would provide an "iron-clad commitment" that funding to address the water crisis in flint, michigan, will be included in the water resources development act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.story continued belowlate tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: pelosi and ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for flint."the amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between speaker ryan and leader pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to wrda as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding flint needs in the final wrda conference report," a pelosi aide said late tuesday night. the water resources legislation could head to the house floor as early as wednesday.pelosi and other democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a cr, to keep the government open without the flint funding. ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up gop votes for a short-term funding bill.with ryan and pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. mcconnell and pelosi had also held discussions on the flint-wrda issue, said gop and democratic sources. mcconnell had been pushing to include flint funding in the wrda package. meanwhile, senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) had been making his own insistence for flint aid clear with republicans.earlier, senate republicans had been considering stripping louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved senate democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. that proposal had come after democrats voted tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure — which would keep the government open until dec. 9 — because the package provides money for louisiana and other states but did nothing to address flint.mcconnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no louisiana disaster relief, one senior gop leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until wednesday. the kentucky republican floated the idea at a news conference tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold."we keep hearing that their position is no flint, no floods," mcconnell said. "that's certainly an option worth discussing."informed of that comment, reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what mcconnell would do, and again said democrats wanted relief for both louisiana and flint.but other democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. "if louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. and that would be helpful,” said senate minority whip richard durbin.“there's still really deep felt feelings by our michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in flint and we don't trust the house to help at all,” durbin added.house minority whip steny hoyer also said democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. “i doubt that we would turn that down,” he told reporters. hoyer said democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the zika virus, which has long been stalled on capitol hill. the measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a july law to curb prescription opioid addiction.senate republicans had argued that the proper place for flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through congress. the senate passed the water resources development act, which includes $220 million for flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.“why do you feel as if you have to punish people in louisiana who are digging out from a flood — sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out — for flint when there’s a pathway forward on flint through the wrda bill?” argued gop sen. bill cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of louisiana.still, despite vows from some senate republicans that flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the house and senate in a lame duck session, democrats had been skeptical.meanwhile, democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the securities and exchange commission’s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. but that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over flint.mcconnell and reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. if the senate is able to pass a funding bill, the house would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like jon tester of montana, joe manchin of west virginia and joe donnelly of indiana, as well as bill nelson of florida, where the zika virus is spreading quickly.thirteen republicans joined most democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah, and south carolina’s lindsey graham. cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the internet domain system to an international body. graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the export-import bank.heather caygle, rachael bade and annie snider contributed to this story.authors:

1	trump hints obama to blame for charlotte unrest but he also presented himself as someone who could heal america's racial divide.donald trump on thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in charlotte, north carolina, on president barack obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.”pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in pittsburgh to address the charlotte unrest, trump also presented himself as the man to heal america’s racial divide.story continued below“before going any further today, i want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” trump said. “america desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.”he called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding african-american families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.”he also vowed to make american cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. and he took a shot at obama’s leadership, or lack thereof.“we all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. i mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” trump said. “many americans are watching the unrest in charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the tv screens. others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. how can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?”trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save african-american lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from african-americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.trump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent hillary clinton's 80-point advantage among african- americans. and his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in chicago, obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in charlotte.still, trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. earlier thursday, during a phone interview with “fox and friends,” the republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.”“i mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “you’re seeing it. i'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.”protests over the killing of keith lamont scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on tuesday, turned violent on wednesday night, leading north carolina gov. pat mccrory to declare a state of emergency in charlotte.by thursday, charlotte officials and scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney told reporters that police believe scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. putney said the video would be shown to scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.at a press conference thursday afternoon, attorneys for scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. charles monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video "can somehow help us reach that truth."justin bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where scott was shot. bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. they come from different sources.” he said that as far as he was aware, scott did not own a gun. bamberg also confirmed that scott’s wife was present when he was shot.“at the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. that has to be understood,” bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “yes, we want transparency. we don't create the facts. we live with the facts. but you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.”the obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. et on thursday.attorney general loretta lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “i know that these are difficult times, and i know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “but i also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. let us seek all peaceful way forward.”white house press secretary josh earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.“unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “we've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.”wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown charlotte. according to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.“i see it even going out. there’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” trump said. “there’s a lack of something. something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.”the real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.“well, it’s wow, here we go again,” trump said. “it’s very sad. when you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. it’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. i’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.”trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.“if you look at dallas, there was a dialogue. they prided themselves on dialogue,” trump said. “and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. a terrible, terrible situation. that sounds good. it sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.”what’s necessary, trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from america’s current leader.“well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” trump said. “you look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. it’s so sad to see. you know, this is the united states of america. i mean, it’s so sad to see. but there’s just no unity. there has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.”but what trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york mayor rudy giuliani appeared in separate fox news segments in which they both slammed obama’s lack of leadership.“first of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first african-american president took office, eight years after we’ve had two african-american attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and i think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” gingrich said.“but my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “he could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. and instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, ferguson was wrong and why florida was wrong.”giuliani said obama should have lectured americans on constitutional law wednesday. referring to last friday’s shooting death of terence crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former new york mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.”“but even there, you gotta say to people, ‘wait, let the investigation play out.’ the president of the united states should have said that yesterday,” giuliani said. “the president of the united states should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”authors:

1	on wednesday, the senate is expected to override president obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia.so how exactly does a veto override work?the rules are described in article 1, section 7 of the constitution. when the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. then, the members of that chamber "shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it."in other words, the president sends vetoed senate bills back to the senate to reconsider first and vetoed house bills back to the house to reconsider first. in this case, the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, or jasta, began in the senate, so the senate votes first.both the house and the senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. both chambers also require the "yeas and nays" to be counted. in the house, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk.though the senate received president obama’s veto message on friday, they’re not voting on it until wednesday. this is common, according to the congressional research service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the senate floor.then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, "shall the bill pass, the objections of the president of the united states to the contrary notwithstanding?"while some senate democrats and republicans have concerns that the jasta bill would open the united states up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with saudi arabia, a key middle east ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.assuming it clears the senate, the jasta veto override will then head to the house, where the same voting process will ensue.if the veto override is successful in the house and the senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.
1	president obama is right — it appears the people running the trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes.after donald trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.wrong.as usual, no one in the trump campaign learns their lesson. and their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.trump’s campaign chair in the prominent mahoning county in ohio, kathy miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. she also said there wasn’t “any racism until obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table:if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. you’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. you’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. you had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. it’s not our fault, certainly.miller then doubled down, calling the black lives matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the african american community as due to “the way they’re raised.”what does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? maybe miller should take a look at the fact that the trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. of course trump’s ohio state director, bob paduchik stressed that miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held.once again, the trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.featured image a screen-grab

1	monday night was the most-watched debate in american history.well over 80 million people tuned in to see hillary clinton and donald trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates.according to nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the tv channels that carried it live.many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web.nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional tv channels at home. people who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. neither were c-span viewers.this means the actual total audience is even higher.on the tv side, cnn and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. so did the broadcast networks.nbc had the biggest audience overall, partly because "nbc nightly news" anchor lester holt was the moderator of the debate. upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on nbc.abc drew 13.5 million viewers, cbs drew 12.1 million, fox news drew 11.4 million, cnn drew 9.9 million, the fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and msnbc drew 4.9 million.the debate was also a hit on spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on univision and 1.8 million on telemundo.trump may have been the ratings magnet, but clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. by tuesday there was a media consensus that clinton had prevailed in the debate.the debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when jimmy carter and ronald reagan debated just once before the election.more recently, the first obama-romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.detailed nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.the vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the clinton campaign celebrated on tuesday.earlier story: ratings expectations for first trump-clinton debate are sky highanticipation for the clinton-trump meeting had been mounting for months. television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.there will be two more debates between the candidates in october.on monday night twitter said the first face-off was the "most tweeted debate ever."given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.various live streams on youtube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.on both twitter and facebook, trump was a livelier subject than clinton. twitter said the "final share of conversation around the candidates on stage" was 62% for trump and 38% for clinton.on facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with trump earning 79% share of conversation and clinton having the remaining 21%.being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. most commentators gave clinton the edge over trump after the debate.still, the post-debate coverage on tv focused on trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.cnn's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by clinton and trump and found that trump made a greater number of misleading statements.

1	wouldn’t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? well, that’s exactly what happened when anti-gay arizona pastor stephen anderson stopped by botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.anderson’s road to botswana was an eventful one, with the united kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. this forced him to find a “roundabout” way to get to botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. but after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere.“i have identified steven anderson as an undesirable person to travel to south africa,” home affairs minister malusi gigaba told the bbc. the country’s constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in botswana) — and if you’ve ever listened to anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his ‘thing.’ the government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a “prohibited immigrant”:pastor #stevenanderson, a #usa citizen has been declared a prohibited immigrant and as such is being deported from #botswana — botswana government (@bwgovernment) september 20, 2016what prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be “stoned to death.” anderson also repeated his praise of the pulse nightclub shooter. while he says he doesn’t advocate violence, the victims were “disgusting homosexuals who the bible says are worthy of death, the bible says the government should put them to death, so why would i be sad if these horrible people died that the bible says should die anyway.”anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the bible supports slavery, that while he doesn’t believe the bible condones slavery (it does), “if it did then yes i would condone it” because “the bible is always right and i am not smarter than god.”in the past, anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in france earlier this year on the country’s acceptance of “f*ggots,” has called the orlando massacre “good news” because a bunch of “f*ggots” died (he later expanded on that by adding that “perfect christians” would “bathe” in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to god), has prayed for the death of president obama and asked god to rip out caitlyn jenner’s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world “to cure aids.”you can watch anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below. if you’re anything like me, you’ll play it on repeat and laugh.you can see an interview with his camera guy here:featured image via screen capture

1	sen. mitch mcconnell said a filed spending measure is the "result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle." | getty mcconnell plays hardball in spending fightmitch mcconnell is playing hardball — forcing democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.with spending negotiations still stymied at the capitol, mcconnell filed a new short-term government spending measure thursday that concedes key priorities to democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board.story continued belowgone is the so-called icann provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for sen. ted cruz (r-texas) and other gop senators and just got the seal of endorsement from gop nominee donald trump. it also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in june.the new spending measure mcconnell filed thursday — which funds the government until dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between democrats and republicans to deal with additional funding for the zika virus epidemic. a procedural vote on the measure is slated for tuesday afternoon, and mcconnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.“there have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. so that’s what i’ve just offered,” mcconnell said. “it’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.”but democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable republicans leave washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as louisiana, west virginia and maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in flint, michigan.“to put louisiana in without flint is like waving a red flag. i don't get it," said new york sen. chuck schumer, the third-ranking senate democrat. "i haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having louisiana and not michigan."it also does not remove language that prohibits the securities and exchange commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. that is current law, but democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. democrats also floated a provision related to the export-import bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure mcconnell filed thursday. that ex-im provision was also important for some republicans; south carolina sen. lindsey graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.“the president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” white house press secretary josh earnest said thursday, while slamming republicans for their opposition to the ex-im bank.yet mcconnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through democrats. while some leading senate democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other democrats began to side with republicans. democratic sen. bill nelson, whose home state of florida has been the nation's epicenter of the zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat zika "with no political riders.""while i support the people of flint, my priority is the people of florida," nelson said.senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before mcconnell went to the floor to unveil it thursday afternoon.“we’re in no hurry to go anyplace, ok? we have all a lot of time,” reid told reporters. “i’ve talked with [house minority leader nancy pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. the president is not going to agree to this. it’s really unfair to the american people.”during her weekly news conference earlier thursday, pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. it falls very short.”maryland sen. barbara mikulski, the top democratic appropriator, charged mcconnell with filing a “republican-only bill" and said democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.house speaker paul ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want "low drama" in order to solve the government funding impasse. but cruz is pressuring house lawmakers to fight on behalf of the internet domain provision that he championed."i am grateful for my senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate," cruz said in a statement. "i encourage my colleagues in the house to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the internet."heather caygle, louis nelson, burgess everett and ashley gold contributed to this report.authors:

1	donald trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too.federal election commission records show that the u.s. secret service has paid the trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.story continued belowit’s standard practice for the agency — which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials — to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.in fact, the secret service has reimbursed the clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.the difference with trump is that one of his companies, tag air, inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.the clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called executive fliteways in which the clintons do not have any ownership interest.“the taxpayers are actually reimbursing trump for the travel of the secret service agents," said brett kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm akerman llp. "it's just another example of how the trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at trump-owned facilities."trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks responded to questions about the secret service payments by saying “everything was done in accordance with fec guidelines and regulations. please direct further questions to usss.”secret service spokeswoman nicole mainor said the fec “specifically requires security personnel such as the secret service to reimburse campaigns for seats” on charter aircraft.a politico analysis of fec records found that, through the end of august, trump’s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his manhattan office tower.but the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to tag air, inc.trump, who once said “i could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. he has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.the campaign in a statement on thursday rejected that criticism as “misleading and flat out wrong,” pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that trump has pumped into the campaign.the statement explained the campaign’s payments to tag air and other trump-owned companies by saying “the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all fec requirements throughout the campaign.”the government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their secret service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to craig engle, a political lawyer at arent fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the federal election commission."it's basically just calling it even," engle said. "it's either trump making a contribution to the u.s. government, or the u.s. government reimburses the trump campaign for its expenses."the same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. the journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. so it’s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the trump campaign for the cost of staying in a trump-owned hotel or flying on a trump-owned plane.the secret service could also end up paying trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. but those expenses don't appear in fec reports because the government pays them directly.the agency paid the trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the fec reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.of course, trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. in august, trump’s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as xmark llc, black tie protection services and ks global group, as well as local police in places he visited.authors:

minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) in an interview on monday. “we’re just trying to allocate our resources so they’re meaningful to us and our candidates.”schumer’s money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio and eye instead cheaper races in north carolina and missouri. no one has more to gain from a democratic takeover of the senate than schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.schumer’s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party’s candidates and a reflection of democrats’ future challenges. democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight gop seats, so if democrats come up short in november they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates’ committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the dscc and individual candidates. he’s planning a fall event in new york to benefit senate candidates that’s projected to bring in “upwards of another million,” according to a person close to the new york senator.“schumer has been relentless,” said a dscc official.schumer and reid have also appeared at numerous events for senate majority pac, a super pac backing democratic senate hopefuls run by former aides to reid, including his onetime chief of staff, susan mccue. the group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. democrats complain that republican super pacs have far outspent them.“leader reid and senator schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money republicans are pouring into senate races through independent expenditures. the amounts are staggering,” mccue said in a statement.schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. he is up for reelection in new york, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his gop challenger by more than 40 points. however, if past is prologue, schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for democrats. schumer’s colleagues won’t rule out the possibility that he’ll donate more to his party’s senate takeover effort.“if he thinks it will make a difference, he’ll do it. he’s very calculating,” said a democratic senator. “chuck will be there if you need him.”sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.), a close ally of schumer, agreed that the presumptive democratic leader might provide more.“he’s going to watch everything closely. it’s my sense he’s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the senate,” stabenow said.there’s no decision yet on where the dscc might allocate the additional money from schumer. it could go toward races in new hampshire, pennsylvania or nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey florida. using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.“we’re going to make some tough decisions, which haven’t been made yet,” reid said.the national republican senatorial committee has been outraised by the dscc to the tune of $36 million. outside groups like the senate leadership fund are making up the difference, but republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with mcconnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. sen. john thune (r-s.d.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, thune said he’ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.“i don’t think i can probably keep pace with schumer,” thune said in an interview.republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after sen. richard shelby of alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. now the gop hopes that nrsc vice chairs dean heller of nevada and tom cotton of arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. they have yet to give money directly to the group, gop sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the nrsc. the third vice chair joni ernst of iowa gave last week, an aide said tuesday morning.republicans, however, simply don’t have their own chuck schumer. instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of trump to eke out a win.“he’s a machine,” senate majority whip john cornyn of texas said of schumer, his workout partner. but “it may not make a difference,” the texan added.authors:
1	72k shares share this storythe first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential, while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media.there is no love lost between the two businessmen, and cuban even said of trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. the shameless trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure. rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clinton’s hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “that makes me smart.” trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. when asked , “it sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. is that what you meant to say?” trump replied, “no, i didn’t say that at all.”trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed. after the debate cuban said:i get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that i have to spend. and i tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. but i’m not against paying taxes. and i’ll give you a perfect example. when the dallas mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening i had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. i didn’t do it. a couple years ago we had some issues in dallas, i just wrote a check to the general treasury. this year we had, after the shootings in orlando, i had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas. i just wrote a million dollar check to the city of dallas to support a bunch of different programs. i’m, i’m the luckiest guy in the world. there’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. and you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. and you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take..@mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/upnunatukv — stefan becket (@becket) september 27, 2016the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark. cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? no. did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? no.trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed. in trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. one for him, and one for everyone else.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

1	new york – all politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top democrats and republicans fear that will reshape america’s relationships around the world no matter who wins.this week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in new york as the united nations general assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim.story continued belowon monday, hillary clinton will meet with ukrainian president petro poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between vladimir putin and donald trump. she’ll also sit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe, her campaign announced sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of china and north korea while reminding americans of donald trump’s suggestion that america should pull its support from japan and south korea.clinton and trump both have scheduled meetings with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi—an american ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. the democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. trump’s came second and was an attempt by sisi to ensure even dealings, according to egypt’s state news agency. nonetheless it might offer the republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on middle east issues that goes beyond simply banning muslim immigrants from america.keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for mitt romney four years ago and obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking europeans and support the upstart young senator.but none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of american foreign policy.clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that trump and the number of votes he gets in november isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about america turning away from them.“she’s very concerned,” said a clinton aide. “there’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.”certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over america’s borders.“it will have lasting impact,” said sen. ben cardin (d-md.), the ranking member on the foreign relations committee“it has been changed,” agreed rep. peter king (r-n.y.), a former chairman of the homeland security committee and a trump supporter. “it gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.”there has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including trump’s decision to accept an invitation from mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare america’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. and that’s hardly all.there was the alleged russian-led hacking of democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through wikileaks, trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of crimea from the gop party platform, italian prime minister matteo renzi saying he’s personally rooting for clinton, vice president joe biden saying trump doesn’t “understand” nato on a trip to latvia last month, president barack obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election.and just friday, london mayor sadiq khan, speaking in chicago, accused trump of “playing into the hands” of isil.officials openly wonder what clinton’s approach as president would be now to mexican president enrique peña nieto, or how quickly and forcefully nato would restructure if trump wins. what if china or russia or north korea moves to test the new president right after inauguration day? what if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts?while many in washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how clinton, as opposed to trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do.her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on jan. 20 might entail.take poroshenko, who is rebuking putin just by being in office: “it’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, secretary clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said.if trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that u.s. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order.“they will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” king said. “he will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.”if clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that cardin and others compare to the repair mission obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on george w. bush.cardin, who’s firmly behind clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in harare earlier in the year, watching zimbabwean president robert mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter.“can you imagine if trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against isil and we need to get the support of moderate sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? can you imagine what donald trump’s comments about muslims coming to america would have on a leader of a moderate muslim state?” cardin said. “it’s that type of problems that have now been caused.”this has all made for tricky travels for obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far.“it's not a mystery to people overseas that democrats and republicans in the united states have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “so that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.”from the beginning of his presidency, obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the middle east to arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on putin and brought the iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening cuba.he’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the u.n. general assembly tuesday morning.but the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. trump didn’t run his mexico trip by the white house. clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the white house either.“we’re having a serious debate,” said ivo daalder, now the president of the chicago council on global affairs, and obama’s first u.s. permanent representative to nato. “we’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”authors:

1	7.8k shares share this storya ninety-six-year-old world war ii veteran and longtime new yorker contributor roger angell has voted in eighteen elections. as he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the american people.this man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear armageddon, believes that the election of republican nominee donald trump would be a catastrophe on the same level:“my country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the axis powers held most of continental europe, and imperial japan controlled the pacific rim, from the aleutians to the solomon islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “angell acknowledges trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the second world war, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought.“i stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early august, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his purple heart and mr. trump said, “i always wanted to get the purple heart. this was much easier.” mr. trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? this is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. i take this personally, representing as i do the last sliver of the sixteen million americans who served in the military in my war…i experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. i have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend gardner, an infantry captain who landed at normandy beach and fought at hürtgen forest and aachen and the battle of the bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of belfort gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. every american of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war.far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in trump’s case. trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young americans who perished in the jungles of vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose.trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb mr. angell.“mr. trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. he is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “how will i look?” this is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.”on the other hand, mr. angell has glowing praise for democratic nominee hillary clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the presidency:i will cast my own vote for hillary clinton with alacrity and confidence. from the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. she is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. ms. clinton will make a strong and resolute president—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one.he saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a president trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the white house:“if donald trump wins this election, his nights in the white house will very soon resemble those of president obama. a new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out west, another suicide bomber in yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. he needs to respond, but the beginning of this president’s response is always reliably at hand: how will i look?”we absolutely cannot elect a president that will put his own public image above the needs of the american people.read the full article here.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!
1	a louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. this is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. what makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that deputy derrick stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son.and stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is:“stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [christopher] few which would put the officers in imminent danger.”officers went after christopher few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. they claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down few, whose six-year old son, jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.18 rounds were fired although few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and few and jeremy were both shot while still in the car. stafford and his partner, norris greenhouse, said that after few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.that’s always the story, though. it makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.reports claim that neither stafford nor greenhouse knew jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. few was critically wounded, and jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to few and the rest of jeremy’s grieving family. arguments will be heard in court next week, where judge william bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.featured image via louisiana state police facebook page

1	donald trump is turning to snapchat to drum up support from young voters ahead of tonight's presidential debate.the republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network monday.while some candidates including hillary clinton have paid for local snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide.snapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says "debate day: donald j. trump vs. crooked hillary" before sharing with friends.the filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, "make america great again."related: say hello to snap inc.anyone can create a filter on snapchat using the app's geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. it's unclear how much trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide.a spokesperson for the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.sponsored filters have long been a way for snapchat -- now rebranded as snap inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app.related: 100 million? ratings expectations for first trump-clinton debatetrump and clinton have used other social media networks, including twitter (twtr, tech30) and facebook (fb, tech30), to target younger audiences. but snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over."rather than actually try and persuade people, the trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit," the clinton campaign said in a statement. "[this features] a joke that, given trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense."looks like @berniesanders campaign bought sponsored @snapchat geotag filter at @hillaryclinton event pic.twitter.com/yk6zemluh1 — noah gray (@noahgraycnn) january 25, 2016recent polls suggest clinton has failed to gain the kind of enthusiasm that drove younger voters to the polls four and eight years ago.between the two major party candidates, clinton has used snapchat more so far. earlier this year, clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a trump rally in california. clinton also released one during the republican national convention, which featured a quote from trump about how clinton would make a great president.during the primaries, presidential hopefuls like bernie sanders also used a filter during a clinton rally.
1	72k shares share this storythe first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential, while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media.there is no love lost between the two businessmen, and cuban even said of trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.”the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. the shameless trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure. rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clinton’s hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “that makes me smart.” trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. when asked , “it sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. is that what you meant to say?” trump replied, “no, i didn’t say that at all.”trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed. after the debate cuban said:i get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that i have to spend. and i tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. but i’m not against paying taxes. and i’ll give you a perfect example. when the dallas mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening i had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. i didn’t do it. a couple years ago we had some issues in dallas, i just wrote a check to the general treasury. this year we had, after the shootings in orlando, i had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas. i just wrote a million dollar check to the city of dallas to support a bunch of different programs. i’m, i’m the luckiest guy in the world. there’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. and you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. and you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take..@mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/upnunatukv — stefan becket (@becket) september 27, 2016the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark. cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? no. did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? no.trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed. in trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. one for him, and one for everyone else.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

"a judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law."burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. if she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail.popular video this young teenage singer was shocked when keith urban invited her on stage at his concert. a few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:the attorney told new york daily news that her constitutional right to free speech superseded supreme court case law and the judge's discretion.“it's an act of civil disobedience, i understand that," burton told ny daily news. "i’m not anti-police, i work with law enforcement and i hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record i do believe all lives matter. but at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system."mike brickner, the senior policy director of the american civil liberties union of ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied."there have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it," brickner wrote in a july 22 email to wkbn. "many times this has been done to retain the defendant’s right to a fair trial."
1	former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation.the congressional report, titled,“the clinton foundation and the india success story,” was initiated by rep. marsha blackburn, a tennessee republican and vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee.the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.the congressional report focused on clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy, which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv/aids drugs to third world countries.it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur, a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the u.s. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm. the company was vulnerable to u.s. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the u.s. market.ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.the department of justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.“this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said u.s. attorney for the district of maryland rod j. rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty.“when companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the fda’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said stuart f. delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice, when the government announced its action against the indian company.the department of justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.“the question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf.the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign.blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state, where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obama’s first term.the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian-americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration (fda) and the securities and exchange commission.the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation’s vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda.it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs.propublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the u.s. agency for international development allocated $9 million to ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”“substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from hiv-related infections,” roger bate, an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told thedcnf.thakur told thedcnf that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients.“these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize,” he said.ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in august 2004, one year after chai began working with the firm. the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa, according to the report.the fda sent a public “warning letter” to ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. it concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral hiv/aids medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”although ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the u.s., chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the company’s hiv/aid drugs to patients abroad.bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy.thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “i have tried to reach out to them,” he told thedcnf. “but i haven’t had a great amount of success with the clinton foundation.”chai was a part of the clinton foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. bill clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.charles ortel, a wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”“in the application, trustees of the new entity, including bill clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. this is not true. they purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘chai’ was by far the largest piece of the original foundation,” ortel told thedcnf.the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.he signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the u.s. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘sub-saharan country’ relating to hiv/aids medicines or technologies,” the report states.chai announced in october 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: ranbaxy; cipla of mumbai, india; matrix labs of hydrabad, india; aspen pharmacare of johannesburg, south africa.chai’s endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the u.s. government under the president’s emergency plan for aids relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former president george w. bush.the flow of u.s. funds combined with clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the fda, according to the congressional study. eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic hiv drugs.the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years,” the report states.the study also examined the key players in the clinton-chai orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions.one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation, which clinton co-founded with indian-american businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in 2001.rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined $9 million in a securities and exchange commission investigation. one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill $3.3 million without board approval.blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the clinton foundation.“you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. to me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author

1	there is a moment at every donald trump rally when donald trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he’s created. “is there any place in america as fun as a donald trump rally?” he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. the moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “trump! trump! trump!” that’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect americans. when you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and mexicans and muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying merry christmas.“donald trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named chris cox, the founder of bikers 4 trump, told me at a recent pensacola rally.story continued belowwhen trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. and his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. they feel like wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. they feel like revival meetings for the donald j. trump church of cultural resentment, with ritual denunciations of crooked hillary clinton, barack obama—“we call him president obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. at a time when americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.his opponent does not. clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. she may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic democratic campaign, politics as very usual.tonight, hillary clinton will take on donald trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. but their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. what 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. and no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is trump. he is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply.whatever you think of clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. the backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “love trumps hate” or “stronger together.” the small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at temple university in philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. the speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. the candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.“i thought it was very substantial, very specific,” glenn mccoy, an adult educator at a catholic church who wore a “hil yes!” pin to clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in orlando. “the purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. we’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.”clinton had better hope not. there’s electricity at trump rallies that hers can’t match. it’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the trump shows live. his crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like nascar fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing chinese, the pc sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and islamic terrorists out of the country. it’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. he flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“it’s 100 degrees in here. and that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) he casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the federal reserve is corrupt, the fbi is covering up for clinton, nafta was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.clinton doesn’t do that. whatever one thinks about her email protocols or benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. she has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. her problem is that trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.nobody understands that better than the political savant named donald j. trump. he tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. but there’s something to his caricature of clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. at a rally in miami, he did a sly imitation of clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.“bom. bom. bom. see ya!” trump smirked. “see ya! i’m going home.”many americans really do seem sick of bom-bom-bom-see-ya politics. but the live experience of trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day.***before attending a recent trump rally in pensacola, i watched a video of his last rally there during the republican primary in january. at the time, the news from the event had been his i’m-just-saying speculation that questions about ted cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. but starting with the star spangled banner, performed by a kids group that later sued trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. he criticized a u.s. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the iranians who briefly captured him. he advised americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” he gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “i didn’t put him there! i’m not paying him!” he read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that common core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the american dream was dead. oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.“whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “don’t pay em. don’t pay em. you know, i believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. terrible. you gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. so we’re not going to pay. i guarantee, i’m not paying for this mic.”so i was ready for more theater of the bizarre when trump returned eight months later to pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. vendors sold trump that bitch t-shirts and trump 2016 confederate flags. the pastor giving the invocation shouted: “tyranny has raised its ugly head! our constitution is under attack!” the crowd started chanting “lock her up!” before trump even appeared. he then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than i had expected.“he’s freeing up our speech,” said one trump supporter.“we can talk about the muslim invasion. we can be against amnesty… maybe we’ll be able to say merry christmas again.”trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in january, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” he said the kind of things regular politicians say: “the history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” and: “once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” he even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. the crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “what about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them?afterwards, though, i saw a breaking story about an offhand comment trump had made warning that if iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. trump had essentially threatened to launch world war 3, and i hadn’t noticed. back at my hotel, i checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including north korean nuclear tests that began under george w. bush. he had mused that “personally, i think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, ok?” he had denied cozying up to russian dictator vladimir putin—and then he had cozied up again: “he’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. if we got along with russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” and at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.”those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the year of trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. we’re normalizing the unprecedented. at a rally a few days later in asheville, n.c., trump called the u.s. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and jim crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. ever! ever! ever!” yet the main trump story from the associated press focused on how he had refrained from attacking clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “restraint on clinton health shows new campaign discipline.” predictably, trump mocked clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the white house, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one.that sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. but it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-i’m-supposed-to-say spirit that trump loyalists love. “he’s not a politician. nobody controls him. a lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our p’s and q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said alan smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby gulf breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. bill turpin, a retired army veteran from brayton, iowa, told me at a trump rally outside des moines that while clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “he’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” again and again, trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and black lives matter thugs.“he’s freeing up our speech,” said norris westfall, an auto detailer who wore an infowars liberty or death t-shirt to a recent trump rally in asheville, n.c. “we can talk about the muslim invasion. we can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. maybe we’ll be able to say merry christmas again.”it’s fashionable to attribute the trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the trump voters i interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. they seemed less anxious about the state of the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about islamophobia than islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. in asheville, i watched an air force veteran named gary latham explode at some anti-trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “lazy motherfuckers! get a fucking job!” he explained to me that america was under siege, with “thousands of syrian refugees embedded in western carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant americans clinton considered “deplorable.”the trump voters i interviewed seemed less anxious about the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.one of the speakers before trump took the stage in asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. she used the opportunity to proclaim: “we want our state rights back!”“we’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says kim buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a don’t tread on me pin to the asheville rally. “trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘screw you! call us deplorable all you want! our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’”trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the democratic playbook.” and he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote trump: “i’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, i don’t really care: what do you have to lose?” his long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. when trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. the trump supporters i interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. polls show that most trump supporters still think obama was born in kenya—and many i spoke to believe he’s also a muslim who supports isis.one notable exception was richard cohen, a jewish contractor who attended the rally in asheville. cohen told me trump is pandering to racism, anti-semitism, and fear of hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier trump event after hearing spectators yell the n-word. but cohen supports trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “a lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” cohen said. “obviously, some do.”this really isn’t normal. and while clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a first lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a secretary of state who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.i remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a senate seat in new york even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the white house after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. she simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue democrat in a democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. and against a basically normal republican candidate, it worked. a majority of new yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the senate to pursue it.in 2016, though, clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. she’s tried to push a standard-issue democratic agenda, but in the year of trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything.***nearly one of every five americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. so clinton’s orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “inclusive economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. in the i-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an america that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. she also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled americans flourish in the economy. just two months before election day, the speech was designed to illustrate clinton’s concern about a worthy issue.it did that, more or less. afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.“i thought it was a nice speech,” lewis smith, a retired mechanic in orlando, told me afterwards. “not very exciting, but i believe she’ll do what she says.”the speech started slowly, as clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-tv soundbites about the riots in charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.the rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. it was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. they’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” maybe some disabled americans create uninspiring art, but not in hillary clinton speeches. “in the united states of america, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” clinton said. this kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young children’s defense fund lawyer to her appointment of the state department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. she mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor christopher reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. she then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers.the audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. but i must confess that after watching trump claim obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the federal reserve and the justice department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. she gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. cable covered a trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter don king dropped an n-bomb in his introduction. there was nothing controversial or unpredictable in clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. she didn’t even mention trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. she was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.geannie bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter.“believe me, i’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”in fairness to clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: the disabled and their families. joe kilsheimer, the mayor of a central florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first eagle scout with down’s syndrome and lead a productive life. “what hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” kilsheimer said. “i know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.”geannie bastian, a university of central florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. but she said her real political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “believe me, i’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.”political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. in any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of trump than it is to find avid clinton fans. voters of color seem especially riled. i repeatedly heard from black democrats offended by trump’s crusade to deny that the first african-american president was american, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “my daughter has a doctorate. her husband is an orthodontist. we’ve got plenty to lose,” said betty edwards, a retired educator in the orlando suburbs. “there’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.”many hispanics are similarly energized by trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. andy gutierrez, a singer and puerto rican voting activist who brought a boricua vota sign to the orlando event, says trump has been a one-man registration machine. “he thinks we’re all mexicans, and we’re all bad,” gutierrez said. “people aren’t super-excited about hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop trump.”clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. at her university event in philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over bernie sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “she’s ok, i guess,” said thomas davidenko, a freshman at temple. “my main worry is trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. but i’d say she knows what she’s doing.” in orlando, i met more actual clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. lou smith, a union cell-tower technician for at&t, said many of his arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for trump—and her bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home.“she’s been around so long, and republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “she’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.”clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. she could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. she might have framed the election as the democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under bush. “when bill clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before obama fixed it,” said jeneka lloyd, who owns a small painting business in orlando. “man, hillary should talk about that.”but trump is not a normal republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed bush as well as obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful fox news interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. it’s a lot harder to persuade americans of the magical thinking behind trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a gold star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of donald trump.so clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. they’ve both gotten dirty. and neither she nor the public has liked it.***tonight on long island, trump and clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. and as usual, no one really has any idea how trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. his team is already warning moderator lester holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given trump’s distant relationship with facts. there will be rules governing the debate, but trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules.what is clear is that trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. he essentially wants to roll back the obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, wall street reforms and climate rules, as well as the obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. but trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the tv era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the oval office and represent an entire nation. if he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either.and yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. she’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. the question for 2016 is whether americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of trump. that question will be decided not by the thousands of americans who flock to trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.but the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. americans never liked it, and trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. but he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. and while politics as usual does have some bogus kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. it’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. and trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.michael grunwald is a senior staff writer for politico magazine.
1	hbo’s real time host bill maher – someone not often inclined to side with donald trump – said that trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism. here’s what he said:“he is for profiling, that’s what he said. but he said we should do it the way israel does. and, like, every once in while donald trump says something right. because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. all police work is profiling. discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart…“what they do is they hire really smart people. this is not the tsa, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. if we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in israel.“and, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. we’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. i mean, i don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.”he’s definitely right about the tsa. their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. not only has the tsa caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. that means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. the rest of the time, it gets through. it’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. how does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (dumb question, i know…it’s government, so of course, it’s going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
1	new york (cnn) hillary clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with donald trump.while she is set to make a quick trip to florida on wednesday, after dipping into pennsylvania on monday, clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront trump next monday night at hofstra university.the lead clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. the terrorism investigation in new york and new jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues.clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with trump. she is preparing for trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to bill clinton's infidelity to her health.trump showed he was willing to go there tuesday when he tweeted, "hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. sleep well hillary - see you at the debate!"just watched they can't say that on a debate stage...can they? replay more videos ... must watch they can't say that on a debate stage...can they? 01:23clinton, in a radio interview tuesday, said she was ready to deal with trump's attacks."i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent," clinton said tuesday on the steve harvey radio show. "i can take it, steve. i can take that kind of stuff. i have been at this, i understand it is a contact sport."to knock trump off his game, people advising clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest.clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of trump's republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. she took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival ted cruz, and studied his style.but democrats worry the first debate will give trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. this, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on clinton.clinton told supporters at an august fundraiser that a friend told her: "there will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. so don't assume they have followed anything.""there will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night," clinton said.a team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including ron klain, who advised obama, and karen dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. she is not setting up a formal "debate camp," aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in chappaqua, new york, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on monday.clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from tony schwartz, who was the co-author for "art of the deal," the best-seller about trump.expectations gameclinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event."for all his lack of substance, trump's showmanship, as ex-reality tv star, makes him a formidable debate foe. he thrashed his rivals in gop debates," brian fallon, clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in august.with her senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with barack obama in 2008 and nine meetings with bernie sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times.trump will not be the first unconventional opponent clinton has faced in a debate. clinton all-but ended her 2000 senate race against rick lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and clinton handily beat him by 12 points in november.just watched debate expectations game is serious business replay more videos ... must watch debate expectations game is serious business 02:46her debate last fall against four democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the democratic party."i'm a progressive. but i'm a progressive who likes to get things done," clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning.clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. the former senator from new york cited the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to wall street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by vermont sen. bernie sanders attacking her on the issue.which trump will show up?in the last few weeks, as clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks.clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate.when asked about the debates, clinton has tried to laud trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at hofstra."i do not know which donald trump will show up," clinton said at an august fundraiser in new york. "maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points."
1	kallstadt, germany — few places in germany are as representative of the country’s heartland as kallstadt, the village in which u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump’s grandfather was born — and from which he was later deported.the hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of frankfurt. it has one bakery and one butcher. every year, kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.trump may have captured a large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. and yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.in fact, few politicians are less popular in germany than trump. a study by the pew research center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.since a local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger, a member of the german parliament, was distantly related to trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “with his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton, trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” steiniger tells politico.trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt. “he stands for everything that’s bad,” says sarah bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.this year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: saumagen-döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a turkish kebab. “everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says bühler. “pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”tanja huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. since the prospect of a trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “they don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about trump,” says huber. “he’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”* * *donald’s grandfather, friedrich trump, was born in kallstadt into a vintner’s family on march 14, 1869. previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “trump,” “dromb” and “trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by gwenda blair; but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on “trump.”germany did not yet exist as a nation; kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom. the region was going though rough times. unemployment was high. those who had the courage, left.friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. at 16 years old, friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina, who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier. he arrived in new york on board the eider on october 19, 1885.he entered the u.s. through official channels, but he had left bavaria illegally. “both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said roland paul, the recently-retired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern.according to documents uncovered by paul, friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the u.s.but friedrich was not done with palatinate. seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by blair. five years after that, he returned once more to kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old elisabeth christ; they were engaged, and friedrich came back a third time to marry her in august 1902.but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had a daughter, friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the u.s. and return to the land of their birth. “my grandmother said, i will marry you, but i will not go back to america with you,” donald trump’s american-born cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in 2012.friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. in 1904, he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt. and although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the united states within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the u.s. with him, according to blair’s family history.back in kallstadt, friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. but though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. on february 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was “to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may 1 of this year, at the latest.”friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. but eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july 1, 1905, and return to new york. shortly after that, donald’s father, fred trump junior, was born.“[the authorities] said, ‘you are not a german citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says walter. “so they left and they went back to america, and that’s why donald and i are here.”friedrich — now named frederick — died in may 1918 of the spanish flu. his widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited kallstadt many times during her life.* * *in february 2012, simone wendel, the german filmmaker from kallstadt, was given an audience with donald trump. roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “kings of kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: donald trump and henry john heinz, the inventor of heinz ketchup.for months, wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. she was only able to secure a visit with the help of walter, trump’s cousin, who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.on the day of her visit, wendel stood nervously next to walter in a conference room on one of trump tower’s top floors. she had brought a linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. but when she asked trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “his assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.“hello, john,” trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking new york’s central park. wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “afterwards, i just kept on thinking, ‘what on earth did i do?’” she says.“the cake looks really good,” trump said, and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.until 1990, trump still claimed his family was swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-german sentiment in the u.s. during the two world wars. but by the time wendel visited, he had become proud of his german roots. “they grow them well in kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “they grow them very well. believe me. it’s good stock.”“wow, it’s beautiful,” trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “that’s fantastic. see how well-maintained it is? everything is perfectly maintained. it’s great.”when their interview was over, walter took wendel on a tour of trump tower. on one of the floors, they ran into trump’s son, eric trump.“have you ever heard the word kallstadt?” wendel asked him.“kallstadt?” trump junior replied, “no, what is it?”
1	hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken.she was born in chicago illinois on december 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. many of you probably remember the legendary actress as liesl von trapp from “the sound of music.” charmian carr definitely left an imprint on hollywood, and she will never be forgotten.tmz reported the death of the 73-year-old on sunday september 18, 2016. carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. at the time that she auditioned for “the sound of music” she was a student at the san fernando valley state college. she was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor.“i was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. one of the girls who modeled with me knew that robert wise, producer-director of the sound of music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old liesl. my friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that i sang and danced. i received a call from mr. wise to come for a tryout. it took me completely by surprise…”after completing “the sound of music” and several other acting parts, carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. charmian started her own interior design business “charmian carr designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by michael jackson.carr married jay brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. they had two beautiful daughters together. she is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.she brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one.i can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!rip charmian carr.
1	as my 25th wedding anniversary approached, i tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife. i had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other. i went to a local coin shop, and as i idled over some of the display cases, i noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others.“oh, the panic of 1857,” the owner said when i asked him about the change of size. “it was really bad. the president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.”story continued belownow that is inept presidential decision-making. during the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. and before the current candidates were known, the two most recent white house occupants, barack obama and george w. bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country.but obama and bush can both take heart. and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. by my reckoning, that place belongs to james buchanan, genial a man though he was. i’ve made quite a study of him. my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of franklin pierce. everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. if i were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about washington or lincoln, or even silent cal coolidge. it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible.buchanan, the only president from my native state, pennsylvania, turned out to be my man.start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of america’s great financial downturns.for a long time before buchanan, in effect, precipitated the panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. there had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in europe, the dissolution of the bank of the united states, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and western land. the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk, from oregon to california to texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states. manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent.then the day before buchanan took office, congress passed what he wanted, the tariff bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive.three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the dred scott supreme court decision, which fell on the shoulders of buchanan. the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but roger taney, the supreme court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with buchanan, of small dickinson college, wanted it settled.scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri, a slave state, but in the northwest territories, which were nonslave. after his master died, scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good.buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five southerners and four northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. he and taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the appeals court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate.ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier, another dickinson alumnus and a justice from pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which taney would write. eventually, a new york native, justice samuel nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional.legend has it that taney, on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided.two days later, the decision came down. taney castigated scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the fugitive slave law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force.historically, experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just taney, but surely buchanan, responsible for it.as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. by midsummer, no one could take a ride on the reading, as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game, since the reading railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central. several lines, like the delaware, lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin, declared bankruptcy.thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. senator william seward, the leader of the new republican party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the illinois central, promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas, was virtually worthless.every bank in new york city effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. the oldest grain company in new york, n.h. wolfe and co., failed in august, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the ohio life insurance and trust co.buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets.the residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by dred scott. instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement, as buchanan had thought, dred scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of northern prosperity.yet the south did not succumb as badly. its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in europe. there was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions. the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being a southern lackey.buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. he said the federal government could do nothing. in his annual message in december 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times.in a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back.throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. when hostilities flared in kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical john brown. when later brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in harpers ferry, west virginia, just 40 miles from washington along the potomac, buchanan again diddled before consulting robert e. lee, who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas. lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid.in other ventures, though, buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. he caused chaos in utah, quelling what he thought to be a mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. he supported mercenary william walker’s forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. then there was the little known pig war, started when a settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest, shot a pig owned by the hudson bay co. that wandered onto his property. a standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. this was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the u.s. army, stretched as thin as could be.as the election of 1860 came close, buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win, stephen douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. that caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election.the southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between lincoln’s election and his inauguration in march, thus under buchanan’s watch. buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it.as the first half-dozen states seceded, buchanan lost several cabinet members—he had a lot of southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former president john tyler, who would himself become a confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold.meanwhile, buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south, fort sumter.enter lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but i contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan, the “worst. president. ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for abe lincoln to climb.today, george w. bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of ’08 and the beginning of the great recession. obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a president hillary clinton or a president donald trump to shine.robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst. president. ever.: james buchanan, the potus rating game, and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents.

1	on saturday, september 17 at 8:30 pm est, an explosion rocked west 23 street in manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. there were no fatalities. officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. the explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in quantico, virginia for analysis. a second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the boston marathon bombing in 2013, was found on west 27th street between the avenues of the americas and seventh avenue. by sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. the chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident saturday morning in seaside heights, new jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5k marine corps charity race. there were no casualties. by sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the ny and nj explosives were traced to the same person.given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. after all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in paris, san bernardino california, orlando florida and nice, to name a few. and of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the september 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. however, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. isn’t that how crimes are solved? law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. they are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.new york city mayor bill de blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the chelsea neighborhood explosion. “there is no specific and credible threat to new york city from any terror organization,” de blasio said late saturday at the news conference. “we believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. i want to assure all new yorkers that the nypd and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? we may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as isis, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. it is still terrorism. it is not an accident. james o’neill, the new york city police commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the mayor made his comments. new york’s governor andrew cuomo was a little more direct than de blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. however, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism.” cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?the two candidates for president hillary clinton and donald trump also weighed in on the chelsea explosion. clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” trump was more direct. “i must tell you that just before i got off the plane a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “but boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. we better get very, very tough. it’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”unfortunately, an incident like the chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” now more than ever, america needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
1	less than a day after protests over the police killing of an african-american man turned violent in north carolina, republican presidential nominee donald trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs."if you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night," said trump in a speech to the shale insight 2016 conference in pittsburgh today.on wednesday night, charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of keith lamont scott on tuesday afternoon. officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. one person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.the republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity."our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. how can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? we honor and recognize the right of all americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others."he continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training."it's tough being a police officer," trump said. "police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed."but aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against african-americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. they cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill african-americans, in many instances unarmed.trump in recent days has appealed to black americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.during a rally earlier this week in north carolina, trump said, "we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. ever, ever, ever,"many african-americans have bristled at that broad assertion. while many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. a pew report released in december shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. and according to the census bureau, almost 73 percent of black americans do not live in poverty.trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. and during a town hall on the fox news channel wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence."i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to," said trump. "we did it in new york. it worked incredibly well. and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."but this morning in an interview on "fox & friends" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for chicago.in pittsburgh, trump delineated a difference between what he called the "violent disruptor" and the rest of the black community. he said it was the country"s job "to make life more comfortable for the african-american parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations."
1	obama to un: ‘giving up liberty, enhances security in america…’ [video]freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. the problem is, liberals hate freedom. oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. they may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is a-ok with them. they can’t ever say this out loud, though. which makes the speech obama just gave to the united nations rather surprising. obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the united states to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.tuesday, obama spoke to the united nations general assembly. “we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “sometimes i am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. but i am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy nowso evidently, obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. how this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. but safety relies on us bringing more muslim refugees into the united states. “ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” obama said.obama may want to take a look at how germany is doing. accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. and right here in the united states, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.how allowing over 110,000 muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. and turning the united states into a country that has to answer to the united nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. it’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. but hey, who needs freedom, right? obama has an agenda to push.
1	getty images wealth of nations trump vs. clinton: a fundamental clash over how the economy works he sees it as zero-sum. she believes all boats rise together. hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into trump’s vision.as he made clear once again in monday night’s debate, donald trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. asked by nbc’s lester holt how to help american workers, trump responded in his usual way, saying america was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the nafta free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.”hillary clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain monday by harking back to bill clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included nafta. ‘i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “incomes went up for everybody.”story continued belowthat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “my whole life is about winning. … i always win,” trump says in explaining why he’s running. the economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “winning the global competition.” you don’t get more zero-sum than that.despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. the zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. as danny vinik recently noted in politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.the recent census report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an america in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. statistically, if the united states is one unit, that is true. but 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. and the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward trump. there is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of african-americans and latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support clinton.no, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. that has been the mantra of clinton and her predecessors in the democratic party, and it was also the foundation of ronald reagan’s appeal. the belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.hillary clinton has continued to deliver that message. at the democratic convention in july she spoke of an america thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. president obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of silicon valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support clinton and the democrats by wide margins.***is either side right? most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. in general, that view is correct. but it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the united states caught in the vortex of rapid change. it does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. they legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. and they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.the voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. hence trump (not to mention bernie sanders’ powerful insurgency in the democratic primaries). the last time so many in the united states were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the progressive movement in the 1890s. many early progressives rebelled against an elite vision of social darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. in 1896, the scion of that view was william jennings bryan, who painted a picture of the united states every bit as bleak and dark as trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate american politics. much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by theodore roosevelt and generations of both republicans and democrats. some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting american influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and wall street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. they aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest clinton and see trump as expressing their world view. for wall street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. in that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. the idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of wall street.we have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. but if trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in american history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. by contrast, the profound strength of the united states has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. a vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.zachary karabell is head of global strategy at envestnet and author of the leading indicators: a short history of the numbers that rule our world. he is a contributing editor at politico magazine.
1	president obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of saudi arabia.“i am returning herewith without my approval s. 2040, the ‘justice against sponsors of terrorism act’ (jasta), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in u.s. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” obama notes in the veto message.“i have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. i also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”the veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. by comparison, former president george w. bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.the last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is lyndon b. johnson.if passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.obama and the white house have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the u.s. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries."overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up u.s. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world," white house press secretary josh earnest explained to reporters today."our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with saudi arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the united states' relationship with countries around the world."but the showdown has also put the obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. saudi arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.the house and senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. a veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the white house says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough democrats to block the override effort.obama's former secretary of state, hillary clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.

[video]there’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. one of our most cherished american rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. however, that’s often not what happens when black lives matter activists set out to make a statement. too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. that was proved true once again in north carolina last night, when a black lives matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.the rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.video: this is what we saw overnight; protestors throwing rocks, blocking a major interstate, face-to-face w/@cmpd @twcnewsclt #keithscott pic.twitter.com/bvhubkj4x9 — christina watkins (@cwatkinstv) september 21, 2016but it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. she was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. she called police, but they never came. instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.🤕try & picture collapsing hillary clinton getting out of bed to deal with chaos & violence in n.c #keithlamontscott pic.twitter.com/kavplhmwpb × 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy now — deplorable trumpcat (@darren32895836) september 21, 2016it didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.message to these black lives matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. that’s not a protest; it’s a riot. and it doesn’t endear anyone to the black lives matter cause. it makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. that doesn’t fix anything.martin luther king, jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. it’s shameful to see the black lives matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. they encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. how they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.
1	hillary clinton and donald trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.the two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at hofstra university in long island, new york, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:1. nominees started off on a friendly note but no escaping the sarcasmhillary clinton and donald trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.when clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and clinton said, “how are you, donald?” perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.shortly after the debate began, trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “but in all fairness to secretary clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “yes, is that ok? good. i want you to be very happy. it's very important to me.”he seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “secretary clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.2. personal attacks came earlyclinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.“donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. i don't buy that. i have a different experience,” clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker.trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics.“for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” trump said.3. trading barbs over tradevoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the trans-pacific partnership trade deal.trump accused clinton of supporting tpp, the proposed trade agreement between the united states and 11 other countries along the pacific rim.“and now you want to approve trans-pacific partnership. you were totally in favor of it,” trump said.clinton fired back, “well, that is just not accurate. i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.”trump then pointed to clinton’s once referring to tpp as the “gold standard of trade deals.”“well, donald, i know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” clinton said.clinton promoted tpp as secretary of state under president obama, who is pushing the trade deal. while speaking in australia in november 15, 2012, clinton said, "tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” clinton came out against the trade deal october of last year, saying that “what i know about it as of today i am not in favor of what i have learned about it.”4. trump asks ‘why not’ blame all the world’s problems on clintonless than 30 minutes into the debate, trump went after clinton, attacking her on trade, isis, taxes, the economy and more. clinton quipped: "i have a feeling by the end of this evening i'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.”trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “why not?”clinton responded: "why not? yeah. why not? just join the debate by saying more crazy things. now, let me say this—“trump interjected: "there's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded trump, "this is secretary clinton's two minutes, please."drew angerer/getty images5. trump hit over not releasing tax returnstrump clashed with his democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.“i don't mind releasing. i'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the u.s. office of government ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.trump then pivoted to attack clinton over her private email server. “i will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said.“i think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. for 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “you got to ask yourself: why won't he release his tax returns?“maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.6. the birther issue gets on the main stagemoderator lester holt asked trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that president obama was born in the united states, bringing the republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.at first, trump claimed that two clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into barack obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when obama released his birth certificate.holt noted that obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015.“nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” trump said, referencing the years between the release and trump’s decision this month to acknowledge obama was born in america. “i figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. but nobody was caring much about it. but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and i think i did a good job.”paul j. richards/afp/getty images7. clinton defends being ‘prepared’ when trump questions her time off the trailtrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “i’ve been all over the place. you decided to stay home and that's ok,” seeming to jab clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff."i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” clinton said. "and, yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing.”throughout the debate, clinton tried to portray trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. she also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: that she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.8. stop and frisk becomes a big point of discussiontrump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the new york police department, was discussed at length during the debate.“stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city. tremendous beyond belief. so when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” trump said.trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.”“they would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal.trump and clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like chicago and new york for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.9. trump and the iraq war under the microscopetoward the end of the debate, holt corrected trump on whether he supported the war in iraq before it started.“i did not support the war in iraq,” trump said. "that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”holt corrected him, saying, “the record shows otherwise.”the only time trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to howard stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. stern asked trump, “are you for invading iraq?"trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “yeah, i guess so. i wish the first time it was done correctly.”despite the attempt to correct him, trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “the record shows that i am right.”10. sparring over staminaholt asked trump about when he once said that clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking trump what he meant by that. trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.”"she doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” trump said. "i said she doesn't have the stamina. and i don't believe she does have the stamina. to be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.”trump has been hitting clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight clinton tried to shut that line of attack down."well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” clinton said.she also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:"one thing lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,” clinton said. "but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.”
1	peaceful protesters crowded charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of keith lamont scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.but none of them stood out monday quite as much as a young girl.zianna oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of charlotte has suffered in the wake of scott's death last week.“i’ve been born and raised in charlotte. and i never felt this way until now and i can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.david t. foster iii/the charlotte observer via ap photoshe expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. scott himself, who was african-american, had seven children.“it’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. and we have tears. we shouldn’t have tears. we need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted "no justice, no peace" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in north carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.protests started on the streets of charlotte after news of scott's shooting broke last tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.david t. foster iii/the charlotte observer via ap photothe scene grew especially tense wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.at the city council meeting, charlotte mayor jennifer roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. at several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and police chief kerr putney.after the meeting wrapped up, the charlotte observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the government center.“release. release. the whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.david t. foster iii/the charlotte observer via ap photoray dotch, scott's brother-in-law, monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with abc news.chief putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. but it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by scott's wife, rakeiya scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. it is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.

1	hillary clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of monday night’s big debate: don’t let donald trump get away with it.and trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the republican nominee and, in any case, clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.”story continued belowthe debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening white house race, with trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. polling averages now show that clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than nate silver declared on monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.”“the latest polling is consistent with a clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. state firewall breaking up. trend lines awful,” silver tweeted.during the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at hofstra university, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator lester holt fact-check trump in real time.“we are concerned that donald trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” clinton campaign manager robby mook told “cbs this morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of holt is that if trump lies, “that that simply be checked.”“the thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. what bothers us, mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs," trump campaign manager kellyanne conway shot back in an interview on msnbc.but conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending trump’s claim that holt may be unfair to him because he’s a democrat and the system is “very unfair.” the “nbc nightly news” anchor has been a registered republican in new york since 2003.“i don’t know that he knew what lester holt’s voter registration was,” said conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why trump lied. “he didn’t lie,” conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.”in a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. after suggesting a debate with no moderator, trump has already signaled to holt that he shouldn’t try to be candy crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between president barack obama and mitt romney with a fact-check of the gop nominee.but clinton’s campaign has beat up on holt’s nbc colleague matt lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.view one week of hillary clinton fact-checks (september 24, 2016) one week of hillary clinton fact-checks (september 24, 2016)the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in sunday. “in our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” janet brown, the commission’s executive director, told cnn’s “reliable sources.”when it comes to fact-checking, brown warned, “i don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the encyclopedia britannica.”for her part, clinton won’t let trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary brian fallon told cnn on monday, insisting that holt shouldn’t, either.“there is enough lies that donald trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “lester holt, hillary clinton will, too, but i think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. by now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. if he says them again, that should be disqualifying. he can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.”former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski, a paid cnn contributor who is still receiving severance from the trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.“i think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the united states. so i think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “you can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but i don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.”trump’s campaign, including his former aide lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that clinton is robotic. that charge was leveled in response to the clinton camp’s preparation for two trumps.“we don’t want donald trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. we’re hoping that can get checked so that hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” mook told nbc’s “today.”asked about clinton’s rules of engagement versus trump, mook added that “it just depends on what donald trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.”view one week of donald trump fact-checks (september 24, 2016) one week of donald trump fact-checks (september 24, 2016)but conway shot down the notion that there’s any other trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. lewandowski cast clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser jason miller tweeted that “overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and conway joined the pile-on.“he’s not going to be robotic and scripted. hillary clinton is,” conway said. “and that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the united states who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.”after mook warned against “a double standard where donald trump can get the most improved award but hillary clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.”“i mean, donald trump has been criticized all weekend long. i think that the clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that donald trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “i'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. but look, they know that campaign debates are not hillary clinton's sweet spot. yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.”aside from how holt will moderate, conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.“i’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut trump ahead of the debate.“what i would ask you all to do is start looking at the twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. these are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. there are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on twitter,” conway said. “ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards donald trump. why are they on our campaign plane? why are they covering our campaign? ... excuse the trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.”conway also indicated that clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance.“so if she ends up saying to him, ‘that’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘he was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “so that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as joe [scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”rudy giuliani, the former new york mayor and a prominent trump surrogate, said he had advised trump to "just let loose" and be himself — and not try to compete with clinton's detailed policy expertise."she's been in government since i was a child. i don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another," giuliani said on "fox and friends." "so she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but i think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on fox news] and when you talk to him on the phone. he's going to be donald trump."authors:
1	i’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered john f. kennedy-hubert humphrey contest just before the 1960 west virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years i've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. but when i ask myself what kind of strategy i would devise for hillary clinton tonight against donald trump, i’m pretty much baffled.the problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (will trump be low-key and calm? will he attack her honesty? will he turn on lester holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) the problem is that almost all of hillary clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. the more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more trump is likely to respond with some version of: “you’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” so reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.story continued belowindeed, this debate offers trump the chance to perform what i’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“yes, mrs. clinton, your experience helped drag us into iraq, and turned syria, libya, the whole middle east into a staging ground for isis. maybe that’s why your husband's cia director, and bobby kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”)further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which trump is in something like the position ronald reagan was in back in 1980. among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “i'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” it's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want carter, but needed reassurance about reagan, which they got. (there is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, clinton is in a much stronger position than president carter was).by contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? if trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the fbi director or the new york times editorial page has said. she can of course cite chapter and verse on trump—bankruptcies, trump university, david farenthold's expose of his charities in the washington post—but those issues are ill-suited, i think, to a face-to-face debate. one of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at trump—and he's still standing.does any of this mean that clinton is facing doom monday night? no. it does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history.the focus is on “moments”—but they’re not always the keyask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:“nixon looked pale and drawn; ford prematurely liberated poland from soviet control; reagan said to carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked americans ‘are you better off?’ four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. lloyd bentsen told dan quayle was no jack kennedy. george h.w. bush looked at his watch. al gore stalked george w. bush, who froze him with a nod.”these are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. they illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. it’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (it’s also why the late political journalist lars erik-nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “you’ve all become theater critics.”)but in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. look back at the first romney-obama debate in 2012. there was no one exchange, no one obama stumble or romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. it was, rather, obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.the presence of trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. but it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” this has special relevance for clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide patti solis-doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. a sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a teleprompter is questionable.there are three debates, not one—and that can matter a whole lotone key reason why the 1980 reagan-carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate john anderson, so reagan faced off against anderson on september 21st. when the independent fell below the polling threshold, carter and reagan met for the first and last time on october 28th—barely a week before the election.every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. that’s what happened with reagan in 1984, and with george w. bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when obama emerged from his daze and outperformed romney in their two other meetings.here, i think, is an opening for clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame "what can you do for my daughter?" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. the danger for her is channeling her inner al gore, who challenged bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: "what about dingell-norwood?" the opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (further, the town meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).trump is not the only one who can deploy political judothe potential for trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. it came in 1992, when independent ross perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.“well,” he said, “they've got a point. i don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. i don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. i don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.”judo, however, can cut both ways. there’s a clear opening for clinton if trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.“well, you might be successful, donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. but you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: mike bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. so does marc cuban, who built his success from the ground up. but i do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.”debates are not decisiveone last note. it’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake monday night. a lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). but is correlation really causation? maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory.in their influential 2013 book, the gamble, political scientists john h. sides and lynn vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. what they found was that even a dramatic event like romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. so you’ll probably want to tune in anywayjeff greenfield is a five-time emmy-winning network television analyst and author.

"you know, one of our guests last night was mark geist, not mark cuban, mark geist, who's a benghazi hero and survivor. and you know, he was within several feet or yards of them and i think it's a good reminder to be americans of what her record is on that particular issue."while the republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.“i had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. i don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. i wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “my microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. which isn't exactly great. i wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”asked if clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up miss universe winner alicia machado, who trump called “miss piggy” and “miss housekeeping” because of her latin heritage. addressing trump directly about the name-calling, clinton said, “donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november."“i know that person, that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst. she was impossible, and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe,” he said. “she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. hillary has to do what she has to do.”authors:

1	obama wears hat, breaking ‘politics 101’ rule on headgearpresident barack obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the white house tribal nations conference.the president was given the hat and blanket by native american leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. he wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.story continued below“what an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” obama said once he took the podium. “i have to say that i am very glad that you also have a blanket for michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. she would, too. i’m just saying.”“that was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.the unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an m1a1 abrams main battle tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the naval academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.“here’s the general rule: you don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “that’s politics 101. you never look good wearing something on your head.”authors:
1	hillary clinton said this year's election will impact the next 50 years of america. | ap photo clinton: ‘the next 50 days will determine the next 50 years’hillary clinton on tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to election day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “steve harvey morning show,” clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.story continued below“every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” clinton said. “this is not: ‘oh, you know, a little here, a little there. we can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ no. the next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and i say that absolutely seriously.”the former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because i need you.”“we gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.clinton’s comments come after president barack obama made an appeal on clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the congressional black caucus foundation on saturday.“my name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” obama said. “tolerance is on the ballot. democracy is on the ballot. justice is on the ballot. good schools are on the ballot. ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”but up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between clinton and trump on monday in new york, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.“i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “you know, i can take it, steve. i can take that kind of stuff. i’ve been at this and, you know, i understand it’s a contact sport.”what clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “you know, his attacks on african-americans and immigrants and muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.as clinton wrapped up her interview, trump taunted her on twitter: “hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. sleep well hillary — see you at the debate!”authors:
1	i was a democrat all my life. i came to washington to serve president john kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy. when the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, i joined his senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. i ran on a (losing) democratic ticket in the new york state elections of 1970. when i was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-governor bill clinton was chairman of my national committee for the police corps.this year, i will vote to elect donald trump as president of the united states.story continued belowso profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.here it is. john and robert kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. to them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. but today’s democrats have become the party of war: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. we have american military bases in 80 countries, and there are now american military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. generals and admirals announce our national policies. theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.nor has the democratic party candidate for president this year, hillary clinton, sought peace. instead she has pushed america into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” she has sought to prevent americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with president vladimir putin of russia by characterizing him as “another hitler.” she proclaims herself ready to invade syria immediately after taking the oath of office. her shadow war cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in iraq, in afghanistan, syria, libya, yemen, in ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. and the democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with russia, for example by sending american warships into the black sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to russia itself.in fact, in all the years of the so-called war on terror, only one potential american president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that america cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that america’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. only one american candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with russia and china, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.that candidate is donald trump. throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with president putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. on this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.it must also be said: mr. trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. he is crude, often vulgar. he has areas of great ignorance. he insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. he would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. he is often intemperate; though it is not trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare putin’s moves in ukraine to what hitler did—an insult that throughout all the cold war and to this day, no american president has ever offered to any soviet or russian leader, not even the enormous butcher josef stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the second world war. and it is not mr. trump but michael morell, a former cia director now high in the councils of the democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing russians,” a doubly illegal act of war.moreover trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-american for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.***john kennedy admired political courage. he began his first campaign for congress at the height of the cold war by saying, “above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. we must not have another war.” years later, in the cuban missile crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the soviet union: there were 13 men in the excomm room, and robert kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.but within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, president kennedy had forged a close working relationship with soviet leader nikita khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic american university speech of 1963. our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a pax americana enforced on the world by american weapons of war.” rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. we all breathe the same air. we all cherish our children’s future. and we are all mortal.” as to our great adversary the soviet union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.”six months later he was dead; and it was robert kennedy who must resume the effort. robert kennedy made ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty the early centerpiece of his senate career. but as president lyndon johnson escalated the war in vietnam, it was that war which forced robert kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.“our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of southeast asia. which of them might have written a poem? which of them might have cured cancer? which of them might have played in a world series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? which of them would have taught a child to read? it is our responsibility to let these men live ... it is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.”he also urged that we consider the vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. he demanded of his colleagues, on the senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of god, the rule of life and death over others. “all this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.”john and robert kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. but they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.the legacy of jfk & rfk is “being abandoned by today’s democratic party.”theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s democratic party. we have broken one middle eastern nation after another. hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of isis, al qaeda, or islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. they cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. they cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the kurds). so a democratic administration, carrying on the work of the bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.scores of democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in vietnam. today there is only the voice of the marvelous democratic member of congress tulsi gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to iraq and knows of what she speaks. and it is a democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see america’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten europe, threaten the united states, threaten western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? why to russia, which the u.s. general who commands nato has announced is the prime “existential” threat to america. as you read this, ground, air and naval forces of nato, led and largely paid for by the united states, have been moving about the western borders of russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since world war ii. at the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the south china sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of china, our second said to be “existential” enemy.there are no russian terrorists ravaging france or italy or america. isis is not to be found on russian soil. the only russian terrorists who have attacked the west are the islamists whom president putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. the only chinese terrorists are uighurs who are attacking not us but china itself. it would seem elementary common sense that america would have long since sought, not to fight with russia and china, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the isis that is terrorizing europe today.former defense secretary william perry, a democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new cold war. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the cold war.”surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by america, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. the years of constant combat have exhausted our military. false hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.but, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. the dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. this is not a danger imported from syria or iraq or russia. our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.for the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. and now we can see the result. the violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. the money we squandered on bombs in iraq was not available for our own schools. the brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. they were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. they were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the american constitution to the least among us. they were not here to protect american cities and enrich american lives.and they were not here to keep americans and american children from murdering american police officers. this is our true present danger.***so my hope for america is this. first, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. we need our best young people to help us here at home. we need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. we need to breathe free again.we must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. isis and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. but we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. we must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. we must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially russia and china.president kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with russia and the russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, ronald reagan said the same. fools in washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. but it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future.second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. there are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.but nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the constitution itself. our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. we need many more and better police. we need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. we need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by ieds in afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in st. louis and chicago and detroit and baton rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.donald trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “america first.” but to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of american statesmen from the founders on. only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. of course we do not hope for domestic discord. but the people of the united states have perhaps stood silent for too long. the elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. these are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. this president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “there can be no business as usual with russia.”surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. we simply cannot fight the entire world, russia and china and all the nations of the mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.and therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as washington, as jefferson, as lincoln, as martin luther king:return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the union, but sought no foreign conquests.do not step over the threshold of a new cold war, a new nuclear arms race with russia and china, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.this, as i understand it, is the platform of donald trump. it was not the republican party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. but it is his platform. it is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. it is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest americans of all parties.well may we seek reassurance whether mr. trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. no one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. but trump has given some evidence. he set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about america than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. and yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.flawed as he may be, trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. you and i will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.truly, america first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. these are the reasons why i will vote for donald trump for president.adam walinsky worked in the department of justice during the kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to sen. robert f. kennedy.

"every president i have served with, including republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an american, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are."biden asked the crowd if they could imagine ronald reagan, "saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""he does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every american politician left, right and center i know have," biden said. "they disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'you’re fired.' they don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit."during the first presidential debate, hillary clinton said trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, "that's called business, by the way.""when you’re sitting atop trump tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that i grew up with?" biden said of trump.the vice president also criticized trump's suggestion that not paying taxes "makes me smart.""he acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. makes him smart," biden said.

1	7.5k shares facebook twittera public high school has been accused of indoctrinated islam into their students. allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of islam, as well as teaching students that the muslims faith is stronger than a christian or jews. this is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past wednesday.the lawsuit was filed on behalf of john and melissa wood with the thomas more law center and the action is being taken against la plata high school in maryland. according to john wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the islamic teachings.richard thompson, president of thomas more, said,“defendants forced wood’s daughter to disparage her christian faith by reciting the shahada, and acknowledging mohammed as her spiritual leader.”the law center commented that for non muslims such as christians and jews that reciting the shahada islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.spokespeople for the charles county public schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. however, the principal evelyn arnold, vice principal shannon morris, and charles county board of education were all named in the lawsuit.the lawsuit says,“during its brief instruction on christianity, defendants failed to cover any portion of the bible or other non-islamic religious texts, such as the ten commandments. instead, the class included disparaging remarks about christianity and the pope. such discriminatory treatment of christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. united states supreme court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of christianity and judaism.”classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average christian. as well, the copies show they taught students that islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.part of the handout reads,“nowhere in the koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. important: the majority of muslims do not live this way.”it referenced the jihad as,“a holy war waged on behalf of islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”this reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. so lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. despite the fact the thomas more center has taken on this case neither the american civil liberties union or the freedom from religion foundation have weighed in on the issue.

1	(cnn) hillary clinton's campaign manager said wednesday that the democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in charlotte, north carolina and tulsa, oklahoma."there are two prongs to her approach," robby mook, hillary for america campaign manager told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." "the first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""there are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations," he continued. "these situations are handled by local policies currently. and what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards."clinton spoke out tuesday against "systematic racism" following the recent shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma. crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. the 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before officer betty shelby fatally shot him. crutcher was unarmed at the time.the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said wednesday that "approximately 12 officers" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott tuesday by a police officer.mook said the other part of clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities."the second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening," he said.clinton told radio host steve harvey on tuesday's "the steve harvey morning show" that she plans to speak "directly to white people" about implicit bias. mook said wednesday clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in america."what she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. it is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way," he said. "if you are african-american or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. and that's a problem."clinton said tuesday that while there are "good, honorable, cool-headed police officers" working across the country, "we can do better.""we have got to tackle systemic racism," clinton said. "this horrible shooting again. how many times do we have to see this in our country?""this is just unbearable," clinton said. "and it needs to be intolerable."clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, "another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. #terencecrutcher -h."another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. #terencecrutcher -h — hillary clinton (@hillaryclinton) september 20, 2016in response to the crutcher shooting, both the department of justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.danny c. williams, us attorney of the northern district of oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.

1	united nations (cnn) president barack obama made an impassioned plea tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis "of epic proportions," despite a political backlash in the us against absorbing those fleeing middle east violence.the president's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a leaders' summit on refugees at the united nations tuesday.at the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the american political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- gop presidential nominee donald trump's call to build a wall along the us-mexico border."this crisis is a test of our common humanity. whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another," obama said, though he didn't mention trump by name.obama singled out the situation in syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly "unacceptable."just watched president obama at the un: then and now replay more videos ... must watch president obama at the un: then and now 01:45"we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop," he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action."i called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time," he said. "just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away jews fleeing nazi germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, i believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment."the refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since world war ii, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old syrian boy who drowned in the mediterranean and the flood of migrants into europe.a recent study by from the un's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees.obama's summit follows a similar un-led meeting on the issue monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments."make no mistake," us secretary of state john kerry said at the un meeting, "additional efforts are urgently needed."leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions."you have to know that today the european union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders," european council president donald tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin."there will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants," he added.the obama administration is hopeful the leader's summit on tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action.national security advisor susan rice in june announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the us by canada, ethiopia, germany, jordan, mexico, sweden and the un secretary general -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees."reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less," rice said in a statement.but aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed."we have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments," said amnesty international's interim executive director margaret huang. "but the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed."the us is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to america from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year.the president's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do."the president's commitment to ensuring that the united states plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in congress, including by a lot of people in the republican majority in congress," press secretary josh earnest told reporters. "and that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort."vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, "are not cheap."david miliband, president of the international rescue committee and a former british foreign secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action."the scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response," miliband told cnn. "governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now."but the co-hosts of the leaders' summit said in a statement they were pleased with "new and significant humanitarian contributions" from world leaders."we sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years," they said. "through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to un appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015."as they await action from world leaders in new york, a group of volunteers in london laid out a "life jacket graveyard" monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the mediterranean.the conflict in syria and resulting migrant crisis in the middle east and europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem.perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called "global south" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. last week, south sudan joined the ranks of syria, afghanistan, and somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad.and protracted conflict in places like somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp."these are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries," huang said.

1	getty images fourth estate in defense of ‘he said/she said’ journalism why we must give the devil his due.the “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since new york university journalism professor jay rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.but the "he said/she said" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the new york times abandoned mechanical balance and published a page one, above-the-fold piece by michael barbaro, shredding donald trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. the times piece elated critics of the "he said/she" said construct. in an atlantic piece titled “the death of ‘he said, she said’ journalism,” peter beinart pronounced barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, beinart stated, and the times had rightly ditched a few of its own. abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the times piece dealt with trump with “astonishing bluntness,” beinart wrote, repeatedly calling trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the "he said/she said" critics.story continued belowwhile i consider trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, i’m not convinced that jettisoning the "he said/she said" blueprint is such a good idea. every politician lies. if we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way barbaro did trump, it would be entertaining. but political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?in his widely applauded critiques of "he said/she said" journalism, rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. the "he said/she said" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.donald trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the "he said/she said" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, hillary clinton. this is true. in speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called george w. bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the iraq war, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the nfl had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. but they are lies, all lies. and every time the media quotes one of trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. at least, so the thinking goes.but has journalists' practice of giving trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? one result of the straight, "he said/she said" coverage of the trump style has been his record lows in the washington post/abc news favorability poll. thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: he’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.as bracing and as full of truth-telling as the barbaro piece was, i hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. the formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. the form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. this, i realize, can be especially challenging with trump because the mouth of manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. he is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both "he said and she said"—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.one reason i admire "he said/she said" journalism is that i often find myself sympathizing with the "she-said" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. whenever the "she-said" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, i get the feeling i’m being fed bunk. even the holy bible gives satan a forum for his dastardly views. so why not news stories?i don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. but intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. in order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.the history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. to oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a "she-said" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.or consider the story of alfred wegener. he 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. or take the example of australian doctor barry marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. even after marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “you think, ‘it’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” marshall told discover magazine. “but it’s not an absolute given.” by the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. in 2005, marshall and a colleague were awarded the nobel prize in medicine for their helicobacter pylori work. science abounds with equally dramatic stories.obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs wegener and marshall enjoyed. but when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. the “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. until 1973, the american psychiatric association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (all is not progress: some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) marijuana makes you mad. (today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. it is now discredited. remember how japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the united states’? remember how federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said the u.s. economic system was stable? experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. and so on.the dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. if they are wrong, as michael shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. if the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. that’s how science works, and i believe journalism should work that way, too. vaccine pioneer jonas salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “first,” salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” second phase: “well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” third phase: “well, we’ve known it all along.”before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying i don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. i do—but at the same time, i keep my options open. the protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. even against crackpots.the last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: so many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. these days, many readers get only the "he said" side of the story or just the "she said" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. while i value partisan media, i also value nonpartisan news operations—like politico—that make ideas duel in their news pages. npr news director michael oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[i]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. that is why the tone of journalism matters so much. we need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”if you’re not getting a steady diet of "she said" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. "he said/she said" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like donald trump.******a sumptuous meal of news, news, news. make mine extra rare, garcon. send news recipes via email to shafer.politico@gmail.com. my email alerts are breakfast. my twitter feed is lunch. and my rss feed is a stingy snack.jack shafer is politico’s senior media writer.

[…] last week the milwaukee county medical examiner announced that thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the journal sentinel. by labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.inmates at the jail say the water in thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. attorney erik j. heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.clarke is reportedly part of a pro-trump bus tour arranged by a super pac that is supporting the candidate.the huffington post also reports that clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”featured image via flickr

1	plastic glasses, knives, forks and food boxes are being been banned in france. (bertrand combaldieu/associated press)paris — france has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.the new law is a part of the country’s energy transition for green growth act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in july. although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some u.s. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as france’s will be.the general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” french lawmakers say.[a maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]objections to plastic as a material are well known. for one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.in the words of french president françois hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make france … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.not all share the enthusiasm of france’s socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. in brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing european union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.eamonn bates, the secretary general of pack2go europe, a brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the associated press that his organization will challenge france’s ban.“we are urging the european commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against france for infringing european law,” he said. “if they don’t, we will.”supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. but ségolène royal, the french environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.the ban was then postponed until 2020.

1	donald trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. he is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.but lately, as trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. that is, trump is only talking to fox news right now.trump is saying “yes” to fox news almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. he called into “fox & friends” on monday morning, he is booked on “the o’reilly factor” monday night, and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday. rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump. if nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.at fox news, trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. fox news hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. at fox news, trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.the problem is, wrapping up in the fox news cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. trump isn’t reaching out.it is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like george w. bush and president obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, trump has rallies with the converted.on election day in 2012, fox news viewers were shocked to find the romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. they may be setting themselves up for a major failure.featured image via flickr

"united states around the world. a lot of businesses. created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world."and trump, knight later indicated, is the person for the white house."believe me when i tell you, i think you’re all gonna agree on this: our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the united states of america," knight said. he noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, "immigration problems and on and on."remarking on his study of history, knight said that he had come to the conclusion that "when i need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man i want to choose and the first man i want to see."knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't "dress as well as politicians dress, but i want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, i wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""and i think that when you leave, i hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the united states," knight said.authors:

"the government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. at this point, the court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer."the magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for rahami, who's at a newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the federal defenders of new york to formally represent rahami.attorney general loretta lynch said wednesday morning that rahami will be brought to new york city in the "near future" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in new jersey and another federal complaint in the garden state.a spokesman for u.s. attorney preet bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.the defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, james patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.josh gerstein is a senior reporter for politico.

1	the recent connected bombings in new york and new jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.hillary clinton and donald trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.john cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the department of homeland security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign "have a significant impact" on voters."when events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong," said cohen, who currently works as an abc news consultant.three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.in an abc news/washington post poll released sept. 11, clinton led, 50 percent to trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.a cbs/new york times poll released sept. 14 had clinton doing "a better job handling terrorism and national security" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with trump's 45 percent.the split was closest in a quinnipiac poll released sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, "regardless of how you intend to vote." in that poll, clinton got 49 percent to trump's 47 percent."traditionally, it's been the republican party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that donald trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats," cohen said.andres kudacki/ap photocurrent events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. but cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.he said trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign muslims from entering the united states "may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [isis'] behalf."james campbell, a professor of political science at the university at buffalo in new york who has written a book about political polarization, told abc news that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for trump."i have to think that terrorist events in this country help trump and hurt clinton. for these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem," he said."it may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with trump. when suspects are identified who have muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny," campbell added.

"while a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the united states marshals service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest."the writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a new jersey court in connection with a shootout monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. rahami is currently in a newark hospital. a judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for sept. 28.defense lawyers contend that rahami has been "without the benefit of counsel" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.while attorney general loretta lynch said wednesday that rahami would be taken to manhattan in the "near future," the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. prosecutors say rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.the letter indicates that lawyers from the federal defenders office in new york have sought appointment in rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's "plainly premature" until he is brought to court. prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.court records show no immediate action from gorenstein on the request for rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.josh gerstein is a senior reporter for politico.authors:

1	newark (cnn) former port authority executives and new jersey gov. chris christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the september 2013 lane closures at the george washington bridge "as bad as possible," according to testimony heard in federal court monday.david wildstein, former port authority director of interstate capital projects, testified that in june 2013, bridget kelly, christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the democratic mayor of fort lee new jersey, mark sokolich, for christie's reelection campaign.wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told kelly that shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge to put some political pressure on sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. sokolich testified last week that being a "democrat in a democratic town" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to "alienate anyone."on august 13, 2013, and as cnn has previously reported, wildstein received an email from kelly saying: "time for some traffic problems in fort lee.""got it," wildstein responded.a phone call with kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony monday."i did not question senior officials in the office of the governor," wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with kelly and his then-boss, former port authority deputy executive director, bill baroni, according to his testimony.wildstein and kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to fort lee officials or the public. they discussed how the port authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to baroni's office and baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.this "radio silence" policy was discussed with and approved by baroni, wildstein said.wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to "maximize the impact on fort lee." wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with baroni and kelly.baroni asked when the first day of school in fort lee was, and when wildstein told baroni it was september 9, baroni smiled and said, "fantastic," according to wildstein's testimony. kelly agreed on the september 9 date.wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three fort lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with port authority engineers who feared this could cause "sideswipe crashes," wildstein recommended to baroni and kelly that they shut down two lanes.on friday, september 6, 2013, wildstein informed several port authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on monday, september 9.bob durando, port authority general manager of the george washington bridge expressed concern, telling wildstein that the closures would cause a "mess."wildstein told durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly."i told him not to say anything to anybody," wildstein testified. wildstein told durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to baroni's office.wildstein then informed former port authority chief engineer, peter zipf, of the closures, and asked zipf to organize a way to get "some numbers" on the traffic patterns.wildstein also informed cedrick fulton, port authority director of tunnels, bridges and terminals. fulton asked if port authority executive director, patrick foye, was aware. wildstein testified that he told fulton "yes," but that this was a lie.all of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.on the day the closures began, wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a port authority administration building on the fort lee side of the george washington bridge."i knew the plan that i had set into motion was working," wildstein testified.a port authority lieutenant also drove wildstein around fort lee so wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.wildstein testified that he called kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and "she was pleased."several calls and emails began coming in to baroni and wildstein from fort lee officials, including the mayor, sokolich, but their plan of "radio silence" was put into effect and no messages were returned.last week, wildstein testified that baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent christie's office's interests.wildstein said he created a phrase that he and baroni often used, "the one constituent rule." this referred to the fact that governor christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to port authority affairs. wildstein and baroni used the "one constituent rule" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.kelly and baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with bridgegate. their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.

1	if there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s vice president joe biden.while speaking in philadelphia, pennsylvania on a campaign stop for hillary clinton, biden tore into some of the remarks from monday’s debate. especially when donald trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the american people, or benefit from their sorrow.biden said:“this is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. what in the hell is he talking about?”adding:“every president i have served with, including republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an american, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”then really getting to the core of it, he said:“he does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every american politician left, right and center i know have. they disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘you’re fired.’ they don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”biden also talked about how trump seems proud of not paying taxes. taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.“he acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. makes him smart. tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. no i really mean it. it angers me.”biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for commander-in-chief. he reiterates:“if this choice isn’t clear, i don’t know –- my lord… what bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the american people.”and it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — hillary rodham clinton should and will be our next president.watch biden lay into trump here:watch: vp biden goes off on trump over trump’s comments about not paying taxes: “it angers me! … what in the hell is he talking about!?” pic.twitter.com/qg5l5hcnvl — nbc nightly news (@nbcnightlynews) september 27, 2016featured image via video screen capture
1	the department of homeland security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | ap photo u.s. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrantsat least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the u.s. were instead granted citizenship, the department of homeland security’s inspector general announced monday.the mistaken citizenships were granted, the department of homeland security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the fbi’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.story continued belowthe discovery was made by the department of homeland security’s office of inspector general, which released a report monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. the department of homeland security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. the fbi’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.the inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only "potentially" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. a statement from the department of homeland security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship."it is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted," department spokesman neema hakim said in the statement. "other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed."in at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” the release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.“this situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of u.s. citizenship through fraud,” inspector general john roth said. “to prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [u.s. citizenship and immigration services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”republican presidential candidate donald trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the u.s. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the gop primary that america temporarily ban all muslims from entering the u.s. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. he has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”authors:
1	the pressure is on hillary clinton.insiders in both parties agree: clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than donald trump when the two square off for the first debate on long island.story continued belowthat’s according to the politico caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. roughly equal percentages of democrats (69 percent) and republicans (74 percent) said clinton is under more pressure to perform than trump. but democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.“she shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give trump a glowing review,” said a nevada democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and trump fails the commander-in-chief test.”“the media and trump himself have set the bar too low for trump,” a new hampshire democrat added. “presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.”one ohio democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.“hillary clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the ohio democrat. “she will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel bill's and barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. donald trump will just have to show up.”republicans also said clinton was under greater scrutiny on monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show trump eclipsing clinton in some battleground states.“somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an ohio republican. “never seen anyone do it before. this will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.”“she has to stop [trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a virginia republican. “all [trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.”among those insiders who said trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of democrats and 26 percent of republicans — most pointed to the gop nominee’s volatile personality.“hillary clinton is expected to do well. she is a policy wonk,” said a michigan republican. “the pressure is on donald trump not to lose his cool. he has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a teleprompter. he will have no such help at the debate, and if i were coaching hillary clinton, i would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. to win the debate, all trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.”“the question we are all waiting to have answered is: can he be serious?” added a michigan democrat. “can he answer questions directly? how will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? can he control his temper?”two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:most insiders expect clinton to “win” the debate.majorities in both parties peg clinton as most likely to be the victor on monday night: 76 percent of democrats and 59 percent of republicans.“media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be hillary,” said an iowa republican.“[clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a new hampshire democrat.but not all democrats were so optimistic about clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.“the press wants trump to win,” said a florida democrat. “their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.”some republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction.“the media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: cnn, nbc, abc and politico will all say she won,” a virginia republican said. “but then again everyone also 'knew' that carter beat reagan in their debate as well.”insiders think the debate will matter.asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.among democratic insiders, 66 percent believe clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle.“trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a michigan democrat predicted. “the moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. he'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored hillary. first impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.”the numbers were flipped for republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the gop standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help trump, 26 percent think it will help clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact.“trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a new hampshire republican. “he does that successfully, and he cuts into hillary's greatest strength.”but some republicans said clinton could stunt trump’s momentum with a strong performance monday night.“if she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an iowa republican. “if it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. she has to have something to stop his momentum. she's got to hit him with a brick.”other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.“we're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless dukakis death penalty answer, the reagan age quip, the bentsen 'you're no john kennedy' moments,” an iowa republican said. “swing voters are like the california condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.”added a florida democrat: “does a damn thing matter this year? i think not.”these are the members of the politico caucus, not all of whom

1	posted by frank wilkenmeyer on 19 sep 2016donald trump jr. is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. in the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and bozo the clown.together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. when this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. maybe we’ll keep track of their twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.today’s silliness begins with oompa loompa jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: colin kaepernick and the national anthem. as more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support black lives matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. lord cheeto ii has been one of the most vocal, accusing kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.for the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st amendment. regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like little comb-over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.for years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to mini douche’s twitter account this morning, i couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. when “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. it’s not. the first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.the supreme court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. i’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and i’ll say it again: the 2nd amendment is the only one they see as absolute. all others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like donald trump jr.featured image by gage skidmore
1	last week i wrote an article titled “donald trump’s amazing week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “never trumpers” everywhere. guess what? this past week has been even better for the 2016 republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. well no one is laughing anymore.the latest round of polls shows that the support for the trump presidency is growing rapidly. the latest fox news poll, which was taken from september 11-14, shows donald trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over democratic nominee hillary clinton at 45%. the la times/usc poll taken from september 9-15 shows trump at 47% with a six-point lead over clinton at 41%. the gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. the suffolk university poll which was taken from september 12-14 shows trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with clinton at 39%. the cnn/orc poll, which was taken september 7-12 shows trump with a 4-point lead over clinton in florida. clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over trump in other key battleground states, including pennsylvania and michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. other states such as nevada and new hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category.donald trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in aston pa, just outside of philadelphia. spearheaded by his daughter ivanka trump, trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. the plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. this benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the earned income tax credit (eitc) program up to $1,200 per year. middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. families will also have the ability to establish dependent care savings accounts (dcsas) to put money aside tax free for childcare. low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. dcsas can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. families can also use the funds in a dcsa to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. finally, trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.donald trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the economic club of new york which includes some of new york’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the dr. oz show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, trump appears to be in excellent health. of course, trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about hillary clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s september 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. again, only donald trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on the dr. oz show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. during the one hour program, the discussion of trump’s health was followed by the appearance of ivanka trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. so yes, somehow all this concern about hillary clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for donald trump.trump followed up the dr. oz interview with a visit to the tonight show with jimmy fallon. during the visit, trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. that is to say, he told fallon that he could “mess up his hair”. while most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes. he demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. furthermore, the tonight show is popular with democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. once again, trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “trump train”. oh and one more thing, by letting jimmy fallon touch his hair on national television, trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. however small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.now if all of this was not enough, donald trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in washington dc where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen medal of honor recipients. trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the us economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”. trump took the microphone and said “not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the medal of honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. i finished it,” he said. “president barack obama was born in the united states, period. now we all want to get back to making america strong and great again.” trump said.once again, political correctness be damned, donald trump has had another “amazing week.”the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
1	donald trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.trump is saying "yes" to fox news almost every day but saying "no" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.he called into "fox & friends" on monday morning, he is booked on "the o'reilly factor" monday night, and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday.rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump. if nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than hillary clinton, but that is no longer true.newt gingrich knocked clinton at a trump rally on monday afternoon by saying "she doesn't do press conferences." but clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as monday morning.these sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while trump has not held a press conference since july.trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since trump made clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point."it's been more than 50 days since donald trump held a press conference," david martosko of the daily mail tweeted monday.trump's recent tv appearances, on "the dr. oz show" and "the tonight show," made news, but not in journalistic settings.the washington post's robert costa had a newsmaking interview with trump last week. but that's the exception to the rule. the new york times last had an interview with trump about a month ago.trump last appeared on cnn in late august. because anderson cooper challenged trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, the post's callum borchers concluded that "it didn't go very well" for trump."it went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of anderson cooper and chuck todd — or, for that matter, chris wallace and bret baier — and stick to softball sessions with sean hannity and the 'fox & friends' crew," borchers wrote afterwards.trump's last time on nbc was the "commander in chief forum" on september 7. moderator matt lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with trump.related: behind the scenes, nbc execs concede matt lauer forum performance was "disaster"the candidate's last time on abc was a short interview with david muir on september 6. his last time on cbs was a "60 minutes" sit-down with lesley stahl on july 17.trump does have another cbs interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.tv networks are agitating for more interviews with both trump and clinton. the difference between the two is that trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.this accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps."trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. at the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible," cnn politics reporter jeremy diamond said on sunday's "reliable sources." "you could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. and that has really changed."diamond said "he is less accessible i think, in many regards, than hillary clinton at this point."trump's campaign declined to comment monday on its media strategy. republican communications strategist ron bonjean said most candidates in trump's position would be "trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""however, most americans already know trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure," bonjean said. "trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience."this conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among trump's critics. "he pretty much exclusively appears on fox news now," judd legum, editor of the liberal news site thinkprogress, tweeted on monday.trump's relationship with hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.according to tvnewser, wednesday's town hall will focus on "issues and concerns surrounding african-americans this election cycle."according to nielsen data, only 1.5% of hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are african american. overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of fox news viewers are african american.

"he's always in there. he's a very friendly guy. that's what's so scary. it's hard when it's home."members of the rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. the case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.investigators are poring over rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to quetta, pakistan in april 2013 and returned to the u.s. through the united arab emirates in march 2014, according to the u.s. official. rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were afghan refugees living in quetta, and that he had traveled by car between pakistan and afghanistan.new jersey state policein august 2014 rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. a complaint filed by a police officer said the officer "has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property," but rahami was not indicted.today rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. he is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.late monday officials announced charges against rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. bail has been set at $5.2 million. it is unclear if rahami has an attorney.a senior afghan official told abc news the afghan government is ready to assist the u.s. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on rahami.new jersey state policeabc news' cindy galli, megan christie, randy kreider, alex hosenball and cho park contributed to this report.[editor's note sept. 28, 2016: the original version of this report said that ahmad rahami came to the u.s. in 2000. rahami's father later told abc news, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that rahami received his green card in 2000.]
1	cleveland — donald trump campaigned wednesday morning in a church in a historically african-american community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban america. within hours, trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.it was just another day in trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by hillary clinton and the democrats.story continued belowthe effort has taken trump from a black church in inner-city detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural north carolina where, on tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities "are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever."on wednesday, trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter don king — who dropped the n-word before a group of pastors at a cleveland church while extolling trump as a “gladiator.” king hailed trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.“the system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” king said.after the church event, trump sat for a “town hall” with fox news host and unabashed supporter sean hannity. asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” trump embraced stop-and-frisk.“we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well,” trump said.fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that bill de blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.but even before trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark tuesday night.“i don't know what mr. trump is talking about to say that the situation for african-americans is worse than it's ever been,” rep. john lewis, the democratic civil rights icon, said wednesday on msnbc. “is he talking about worse than slavery? worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”trump’s polling numbers among african-american voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “what do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.at the new spirit revival center in cleveland, trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.seated to trump’s right was mike pence, his soft-spoken running mate. to his left, outspoken longtime attorney michael cohen. behind him: king (“there’s only one,” trump said), former presidential rival ben carson (“tough”), retired lt. gen. michael flynn (“a tough general”) and former "apprentice" star omarosa manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with trump’s black outreach.“i’m different from a lot of republicans, frankly,” trump said from the pulpit.trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in oklahoma last week. trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents."now, did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, ok?”king, whom top gop officials had pushed not to speak at the republican national convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.king, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of israel and the united states, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only trump can upend it entirely.“every white woman should cast a vote for donald trump,” said king, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of african-americans.“i told michael jackson, i said if you're poor, you're a poor negro — i would use the n-word — but if you rich, you are a rich negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, i mean, negro,” king said.when trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “ah, there’s only one don king.”before king, cohen, trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of trump as a “racist.”“the word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” cohen complained. “i’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label mr. donald trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. and let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, islamophobe, anti-hispanic, anti-semite demagogue. and countless others. it’s disgraceful.”cohen said, “not only is donald trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”trump insisted that democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.“they come and they take your vote,” trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”authors:

"these are challenging times. one thing that i would say about prime minister netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us."that candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between obama and his israeli counterpart, whom the white house has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to us policies like the nuclear agreement with iran. obama's 30-minute meeting wednesday with netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the oval office in january.obama is intent on conferring solid ties with israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see democratic nominee hillary clinton prevail.read more

1	in march, in a bold “oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the washington post’s editorial board, donald trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. there were just five, though he said, “i have quite a few more.” the list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. one of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “carter page, phd.”who?story continued belowreporters quickly googling found that page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called global energy capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in russia and the energy sector. as for his connection to trump, when page was reached for comment by the new york times the day after trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising mr. trump on energy policy and russia.”this piqued my interest: i have been a russia wonk for most of my adult life, i spent years living and reporting from moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. and yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in russia, no one i spoke to had ever heard of carter page.“what’s this guy’s name?” says one former western energy ceo who spent years in russia, and would have overlapped there with page.“i had not heard of carter page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades. “but i am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘have you heard of this guy?’”“strangely, i've never heard of carter page until this trump connection,” bill browder responded to me in an email. he was one of the biggest western players in the russian market until president vladimir putin turned on him and browder became his fierce critic. “it's odd, because i've heard of every other financier who was a player on moscow at the time.”someone, apparently, has heard of him: on friday, yahoo news reported that page was being probed by u.s. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to russian leaders. the story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, trump was surrounding himself with.this has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious washington connections to tap for advice. “i’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people," trump famously told a post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. "we want top-of-the-line professionals.” as the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt, trump confused the kurds with the iranian al-quds force, couldn’t tell the difference between hezbollah and hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of isis. (in his defense, trump said that “hugh was giving me name after name, arab name, arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) the republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-trump manifestos. and since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? what would they be like?enter carter page, a 44-year-old ph.d., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in russia and energy, yet who, i quickly discovered, was known by neither russia experts nor energy experts nor russian energy experts. (“i can poll any number of people involved in energy in russia about carter page and they’ll say, ‘carter who? you mean jimmy carter?’” says one veteran western investor in russian energy.) page also, as i would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to trump’s own campaign.what i did find, however, is that while page might not be helping trump, trump has been a significant help to page. since being named by trump as an adviser, page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in russia and the former soviet union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. he is being treated in russia as a person with potentially important ties in america. “he’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on russia,” says mikhail leontiev, a pro-kremlin talking head and spokesman for rosneft, russia’s state oil giant. “people really respect him in this industry. he’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” according to the yahoo report, u.s. intelligence believes page had an audience with top russian officials—including rosneft head igor sechin—during a summer trip to moscow. from what i could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by trump.page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the american press. a march bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at gazprom,” the state-owned russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. last month, the post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in russia, some of them unsavory. the yahoo story also portrays page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in russia” and an office “around the corner from trump tower.”page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying putin is a better leader than president barack obama to a june closed-door meeting of foreign policy brahmins in washington. in july, in moscow, he spoke at the new economic school’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted obama just seven years ago. page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of american foreign policy in front of a russian audience, saying, “washington and other western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” he is now frequently quoted on russian television, which hails him as a “famous american economist” and “adviser to donald trump on questions of foreign policy.”all of which reveals something deeply strange about trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up twitter controversies. they also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.but someone is paying attention. as i started looking into page, i began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections page has to all kinds of shady russians. one is working on behalf of various unnamed democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to page’s scent. both claimed to me that the fbi was investigating page for allegedly meeting with igor sechin and sergei ivanov, who was until recently putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when page was in moscow in july for that speech.so the question continued to linger: who is carter page?***i should tell you before we get any further that page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. i called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. i emailed him repeatedly. i asked the trump campaign to put me in touch. i emailed the bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. i even called carter page’s father in poughkeepsie, new york, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. but alas, no dice.this was disappointing: no one who worked in moscow when page was there seemed to know who he was, and i just wanted to talk to someone who did. at a certain point, i just needed confirmation that he even existed.ok, i thought. try a different route. maybe all these prominent western businessmen who worked in russia for decades didn’t know page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the russian economy. he did, after all, have such an impressive résumé.page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, global energy capital, hits all the right notes. it was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative russian energy market. “he spent 7 years as an investment banker at merrill lynch in london, moscow and new york where he most recently served as chief operating officer of the energy and power group,” his bio reads. “he was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. he spent 3 years in moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for gazprom, rao ues and others.”those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and page’s tenure in merrill lynch’s moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. he says he was part of the carving up of rao ues, a massive russian electric power holding company. he told bloomberg that he advised gazprom when it bought a stake in the sakhalin ii oil and gas project. those were huge, huge things. if he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. and surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.so i called ian craig, the ceo of sakhalin energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with gazprom and stayed on as ceo after the deal went through. (it wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: sakhalin ii was a large project in the far east, and gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) but craig said he didn’t know anyone named carter page. he was also surprised to hear about merrill lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “i don’t think merrill lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says craig . “it closed at ceo level, and eventually putin himself signed off on it.”when i asked a prominent western businessman, who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with sechin and other members of the russian elite, about page’s claim to bloomberg that he advised gazprom on sakhalin ii, he said, “i rolled my eyes at that one.” (he, too, said he hadn’t heard of page until trump’s announcement.)fine. ok. maybe page exaggerated a bit on that one. but what about the reorganization and privatization of rao ues, the russian electricity giant? maybe some of the russians he worked with remembered a carter page?turns out, they did.“his nickname was stranichkin,” from the russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says artem torchinsky, who met page during the breakup of rao ues. torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside page, who, at the time worked in merrill lynch’s moscow office. it was 2007, and merrill lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of rao ues, and torchinsky was resentful of page and the other merrill lynchers: torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. they were the fancy western window dressing. “it really irritated our team,” torchinsky told me over skype. “we worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. these guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” as for page, “he made no impression whatsoever. whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” torchinsky says. “when you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.”ok, harsh. but then i talked to page’s former boss, former russian central bank chairman sergei aleksashenko, who ran the moscow office of merrill lynch for part of the time page worked there. “he wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “what can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me.page was a vice president at merrill lynch in moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like merrill lynch might have thousands of vps. in the moscow office, there were five ranks, and vp was right in the middle. in effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says aleksashenko.when it came to finance, aleksashenko says, page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” when it came to energy, page and his team were, according to torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” and, says aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.”trump’s putative adviser on russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says aleksashenko.***for the past few years, page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. he has written columns in global policy journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of durham university. they are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “in recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the united states after the killing of michael brown and eric garner by police officers in missouri and new york respectively,” he wrote. “although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” he is the kind of thinker who writes that kanye west’s “new slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of u.s. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the oxford english dictionary (“slave; pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in adam sandler, william f. buckley and dick cheney.his speech in moscow’s new economic school was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “for the last 15 years, i’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. the video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into english. except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, vladimir putin: “we never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. unlike the usa.” which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing america abroad by citing putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, syria or ukraine.page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the council on foreign relations, where he cut a strange figure. like other westerners doing business in russia, page took the view that putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the west imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to russia. but unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of putin, people at the council recall that page was not particularly good at it. “he had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the council says. his columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “that blog post about the slaves. that’s just … strange,” says the council member.“he’s a nice guy, but of the people that i know that have russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one american executive with experience in russia and its energy sector. “you’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like carter page. i mean, wow.”***i should’ve just dropped the carter page story, but in the months since trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. fancy bear, who was probably a russian hacker, broke into the democratic national committee emails, seemingly handed them over to julian assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. trump’s second campaign manager, paul manafort, flamed out in august because of his shady business dealings with the pro-kremlin side of ukraine, and trump himself continues to say absurd things about russia and putin, like publicly inviting the russian government to continue hacking american servers. washington was in full hunt for red october mode, and it was all i could do to stay on page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.i was not the only one. seemingly everyone i talked to had also talked to the washington post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of page’s connections. then there was page, praising putin. i found myself juggling two mutually contradictory page narratives: was page, like manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the west? this was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. was page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with china and turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the kremlin to influence the american election? was he a man who, during a three-day trip to moscow, met with two of russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?but it was hard to see that man when i actually talked to people who knew him. page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at merrill lynch’s london and moscow offices. today, he claims he was cozy with gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “no one let him into gazprom,” aleksashenko says. “he didn’t go shake [gazprom chief alexey] miller’s hand. he made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in london.” another of page’s colleagues from merrill lynch confirmed that page’s role was simply arranging meetings between gazprom and western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “people organize meetings with gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “he hosted these guys in new york city but they would have done this 10 times a year… i used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. you just send out an email to 20 people saying gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? the main thing is just getting those two [gazprom] guys to agree. but because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.”but the meetings did provide him with something else. “gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “they were the most profitable company at the time. their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. he was probably aware of that. he would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them.after merrill lynch, page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it global energy capital. but he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. the fund is registered to his father’s address in poughkeepsie; page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be sergei yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at gazprom. he also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy madison avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from trump tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space.“that’s carter page,” says an american businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in russia. “that’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. he’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in russia is done. i admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.”in the interest of due diligence, i also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that russia’s alfa bank paid for the trip as a favor to the kremlin; that page met with sechin and ivanov in moscow; that he is now being investigated by the fbi for those meetings because sechin and ivanov were both sanctioned for russia’s invasion of ukraine.“i don’t know this person,” said pyotr aven, one of the two founders of alfa bank, which is considered the western russian bank. aven and his partner, mikhail fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of russia and have been quite critical of putin. as for who paid for page’s trip, aven was no less irritated by the question. “i give them money, i don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, i have no idea,” he said of the new economic school, which hosted page and of which aven is the main benefactor. exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “don’t bring these russian-style conspiracy theories to me.”“you are engaged in onanism,” said leontiev, the spokesman for rosneft and sechin when i asked him if page had met with sechin. “it’s bullshit. just bullshit. you need to understand who sechin is to even ask this question. it’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. it’s absurd.”as for the fbi investigation, well, it’s unclear. a state department official who works on russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the fbi. ofac runs them.” he added, “the story doesn't add up.” what does seem to have happened is that various u.s. intelligence agencies were looking into page’s time in moscow, then briefed senate minority leader, democrat harry reid, who wrote a letter to fbi director james comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a trump advisor who has been highly critical of u.s. and european economic sanctions on russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in russian energy conglomerate gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in moscow in july of 2016, well after trump became the presumptive republican nominee.”***i got my next surprise when i called stephen miller, trump’s senior adviser. i caught him just as the trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: who is carter page?“who?” says miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.“he has no formal role in the campaign,” hope hicks texted responding to my question.now my interest was piqued. there were whispers all over washington that, despite hicks’s denial, page was not only still part of the trump campaign, but its conduit for russian influence. was he?one way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.one source suggested to me that richard burt, former u.s. ambassador to germany, start treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for alfa bank, was the nexus. it was burt who helped draft trump’s foreign policy speech in april, and had been advising the trump campaign, via senator jeff sessions, on foreign policy. but when i met burt at his office at the mclarty associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “the only person i talked to about carter page is this guy at the washington post,” burt told me. “and i told him i’d never met the guy. let me put it this way: if i have met him, i’ve forgotten. he’s the former merrill lynch guy, right?”someone else told me that the page connection was rick dearborn, sessions’ chief of staff, who hired page because dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for trump’s alexandria, virginia, policy shop and he happened to know page. but dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither dearborn nor burt, but campaign co-chair sam clovis who recruited page. “if he was part of that original group of people, i can say with 70 percent confidence it was sam clovis,” this person told me.“i’m not answering your questions,” clovis told me. he refused to tell me if he was the one who found page, but jason miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “carter page isn’t someone i’ve interacted with.” which confirmed what a policy staffer on the trump campaign told me: “carter is a red herring, not a rasputin. he’s never met trump, never briefed him. he has zero influence, none.”***was page the shadowy messenger between the kremlin and trump tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“who?” maybe i wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the russians were running, page was firmly in the latter camp.“i don’t know about his russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom page has pitched on various energy projects. “every conversation i’ve had with carter has not been terribly serious. they’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. there are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” he went on. “i couldn’t name a project that i could connect carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.”“i don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but i think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. if you hang around russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.”strangely, it was not a russian pinball that hit him; it was trump. according to the trump policy adviser, this winter, clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. at a time when established republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from trump, “a lot of people came to sam clovis in february, march, and said, ‘i want to be part of the team,’” says the trump adviser. and that’s how it happened. “he’s just a guy on a list. trump looked at the list and said, ‘he’s an adviser.’ and now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.”now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a very important person in washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “i was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, i had never heard of him,” one russia specialist in washington told me. he saw page at a washington roundtable in june for indian prime minister narendra modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “he was saying he was planning to go to moscow,” the russia specialist recalls. “he didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.”according to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on page’s trip to russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. i think the investigation is more what happened in them.” but it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “it’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against america’s national security interests? wittingly or un-, i should add. it’s what’s hard to parse about this. is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a john le carré novel? or are they being played by much smarter people in the kremlin?”this seems to be vintage carter page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. but he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “if page using his status as ‘trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: time for page to join twitter!” michael mcfaul, former u.s. ambassador to russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. the russians may be feeling out the trump campaign via page, but page must be loving every minute of it. after all, meeting russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when trump said three words in march: “carter page, ph.d.” now carter page, ph.d., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious trump shark.for months now, the american press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like page and manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether putin is trying to destroy america by their hands, and is trump a kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?there doesn’t seem to be one in the world of trump, which in some ways resembles putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. and that is all that matters. is putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “i want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of russia,” putin says of the rumors of russian meddling in the american election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.julia ioffe is contributing writer at politico magazine.
1	like much of the mainstream media, the washington post is going out of its way to disparage donald trump. but the post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the republican nominee. that must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate hitler references. twice in this month post columnists have compared donald trump to adolf hitler. perhaps the editors have designated september as “trump is hitler month” at the washington post.on monday they featured a column by richard cohen which said in part,(…) while trump is neither an anti-semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is hitlerian in his thinking. he thinks the truth is what he says it is.mr. cohen didn’t mention what despot hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “hillary is hitler month.” while a hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “trump” month is incredibly sexist.six day’s before mr. cohen, another columnist shalom auslander wrote, “don’t compare donald trump to adolf hitler. it belittles…the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
1	2016 obama’s team isn’t laughing at trump anymore the president’s aides worry the republican represents more of america than a fringe.obamaworld laughed as it watched donald trump’s hostile takeover of the gop. after eight years of republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, president barack obama’s aides, past and present, thought republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.they’re not laughing anymore.story continued belowgoing into monday night’s debate, obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top hillary clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that trump could end up in the oval office in part due to a backlash against obama.“i’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said ben labolt, a former white house aide and press secretary for obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “i feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘breaking bad’ here. we’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.”“there's not a lot of mirth in the circles i run in about him,” said another former senior obama campaign staffer.privately, obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. he’s still nursing amusement at republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many americans he failed to reach. people who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of obamacare—support democrats.for obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' even if clinton wins, the republican has shown not only that america is divided between red and blue but that there’s an america that obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as monopoly money.“we are still the country that elected barack obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said jim papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the white house. “but we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.”trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. and that was even before he riled up obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.and the result: trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than obama’s team imagined. with 43 days to go, trump and clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.though only a few weeks ago, current and former obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the republican party destroying itself in front of him. now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that trump also occupies.“i don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, i don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said dan pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “trumpism is a lot of things in this country. president obama is the face of that for some republicans, but the republican party got themselves into this mess.”but they worry about what even a trump loss says about obama’s america.“i think he will lose badly in this election, but i think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said tommy vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at trump ended a year ago. “he’s made us look stupid. i think he is stupid.”for any efforts obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “trump has shattered that,” vietor said. “he has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. that’s a bad lesson for people to learn.”according to earnest, obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. the sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in clinton’s chances.“i’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the national mall, but i am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said white house press secretary josh earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.not everyone’s inside obamaworld is down. some schadenfreude remains.“he's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the gop, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former obama 2008 campaign spokesman hari sevugan.and democrats’ sense of the vacuous gop that trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.“the eight-year legacy of the recovery from the great recession is clear evidence that the tea party movement,” said earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.”but that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of american politics.“i’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” papa said, “than have a political edge on the republican party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”authors:

1	there may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.do men smile all the time? no. because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. same goes for women.not every situation calls for a smile at all times. especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. so, when rnc chair reince priebus thought it appropriate to criticize hillary clinton for not smiling enough during the nbc forum hosted by matt lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.one person who definitely had a lot to say about priebus and his request of a smile from hillary was none other than chelsea handler on her hit netflix show chelsea.chelsea began by asking priebus:“who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”adding:“this is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”chelsea then said:“stop telling women to smile. we don’t like that. it’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”going for priebus’ jugular, chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:“you know when women will smile? when hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces trump in november.”and that’s exactly right.watch the full video here:featured image via video screen capture
1	off message is donald trump qualified to be president? in the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.h.l. mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.”likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on monday: as the first serious job interview for potential president donald john trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.story continued belowyeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for hillary clinton too. she’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. she needs to prove she can stand up to trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second john roberts drops the swearing-in bible.but the spotlight belongs on trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. she’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and trump was engaged to marla maples.everyone makes the orange jokes, but trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring american prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). he’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a d student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.these are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. they are facts based on reporting and trump’s own public performances. here are five questions trump needs to address on monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: is donald trump qualified to be president of the united states?1. does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country?only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. in recent days, trump — who swooned after clinton’s superb convention in philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like ohio and iowa since aug. 1. he’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. but he can win. fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.his resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except trump and his team: the country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.the first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the doris kearns goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. it probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream.this is not to suggest that trump can’t do the job (ronald reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware russia had annexed crimea until george stephanopoulos informed him recently. he obliterated jeb bush, that humbled patsy of the gop establishment, in the debates — but bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by beijing that could lead to a global depression. trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care.the caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. in april, i sat down with one of his longtime advisers, roger stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “all you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said stone, who has known the gop nominee for decades. “when you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. he's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. it's just too boring. don't blame him; i don't like it either. so keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.”stone argued that trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. but george w. bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer peter baker, said that bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in iraq. and during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, president obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.many americans might not give a damn that he knows what hud’s section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. but don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?2. does trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of american constitutional government?again, this is not a given. hillary clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in february, went so far as to say: “we're going to open up those libel laws. so when the new york times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.”that’s a new one for a presidential nominee. as corey brettschneider wrote in politico magazine last month: “for more than 50 years, the supreme court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”during a private meeting with hill republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “article 12 of the constitution.” the framers stopped at seven. “he was just listing out numbers,” said congressman blake farenthold (r-texas), a trump backer at the time. “i think he was confusing articles and amendments.”ok, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. but consider his reaction to the paris bombings last november when trump told fox news he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” the comment was decried by constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “free exercise” clause of the first amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.3. why won’t trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?hillary clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big wall street firms like goldman sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. and serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the clinton foundation, the state department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.but the clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.why does it matter? because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the white house, senate and state department. at issue is trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” he is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much).more serious is the issue of trump’s debts: the clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in china and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. if that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns.this isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: many republicans, including supporters like house speaker paul ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.4. what’s the deal with his charitable foundation? then there’s the matter of trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. in exposé after exposé, washington post reporter david fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that trump himself has conceded might be illegal.the problem, yet again, is that trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of fahrenthold and others.5. why lie? these days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. if presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.but if trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.hillary clinton (“crooked hillary” in trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of gop congressional investigators.but it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the republican party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially george w. bush’s claims about iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (a recitation of trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read politico’s comprehensive “donald trump’s week of misrepresentations, exaggerations and half-truths” for a taste.)in an attempt to defend trump, buddy newt gingrich, who lobbied to be trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…”but getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. it’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.authors:
0	335 shares share this storyrepublican attacks on transgendered americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when virginia republican mark cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the literary fund. any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.he did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the department of justice ruled in june was a violation of the student’s rights. it is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the gop must accept that america is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.
0	breaking!liberal rag huffington post is really running with this story from the washington post about the cia “confirming” russian interference in the presidential election.they’re saying if 100% true, the courts can put hillary in the white house!scary!from huffpo:a 1995 federal court ruling out of pennsylvania may offer some clues to clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.in light of late-breaking reports friday evening that russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist donald trump’s victory, clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.at 10:45 p.m. friday evening, the washington post broke an explosive story alleging that russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist donald trump in a victory over democratic candidate hillary clinton. the story reveals that a cia assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to president obama and top congressional leaders last week.the development has clinton supporters and other concerned americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. no clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. article ii of the u.s. constitution vests congress with the power to determine the date by which the electoral college will cast their votes, presently set for december 19. in recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the electoral college to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for clinton instead of trump has garnered national attention.the electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like hamilton’s electors, which claims that the purpose of the electoral college is to prevent demagogues like mr. trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. a petition urging the electoral college to make hillary clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. with donald trump having won 306 electoral college votes, 37 republican electors would need to switch their votes to clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the republican-controlled house of representatives.

0	on monday, bumble bee foods and 2 employees were charged by los angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. josé melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company’s santa fe springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. temperatures reached 270° during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. the body of melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.the company, its plant operations director angel rodriguez and former safety manager saul florez were each charged with three counts of violating occupational safety and health administration rules that caused a death. the charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.rodriguez, 63, of riverside and florez, 42, of whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. bumble bee foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. “we remain devastated by the loss of her colleague josé melena in the tragic accident,” company said in a statement. “we disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the los angeles dist. atty.’s office.”according to the associated press, florez refused to comment and messages seeking comment from rodriguez were not immediately returned.
0	republican rep. trey gowdy, who sits on the house judiciary committee, suggested in a friday interview that fbi deputy director andrew mccabe will be forced out at the top law enforcement agency as soon as next week.gowdy argued that newly released fbi records reveal political bias against president donald trump — and in favor of hillary clinton — at the highest levels of the fbi. gowdy said that mccabe will likely be pushed out of the agency as a result of the perceived bias."i'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the fbi this time next week," gowdy told fox news of mccabe, adding that he would be "shocked" if mccabe testifies before the house next week.the washington post reported last week that gowdy settled a $150,000 veteran discrimination and retaliation claim from a former aide, who was fired in 2015 from the house benghazi committee investigating the 2012 attacks in benghazi, libya. the aide alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in part for his unwillingness to engage in what he believed was a partisan investigation into hillary clinton's time as us secretary of state.attacks on special counsel robert mueller's team of investigators have escalated sharply in recent weeks, culminating in a partisan haranguing of the fbi director last week over the perceived missteps of his predecessor.conservative and far-right media outlets, already skeptical of mueller's probe into president donald trump's ties to russia, grew louder in their calls for fbi director chris wray to either clean house or for mueller to resign. it came after news that two special counsel investigators at one point exhibited perceived political bias.trump again characterized the criminal justice system as "rigged" during a rally in florida on friday, echoing comments he made last weekend following former national security michael flynn's guilty plea as part of mueller's probe.president donald trump lamented the state of the fbi, the nation's top law-enforcement agency, shortly before delivering a speech at an fbi graduation ceremony on friday in quantico, virginia."it's a shame what's happened with the fbi, but we're going to rebuild the fbi. it'll be bigger and better than ever," trump told reporters before boarding virginia-bound marine one on friday morning.the president also recently described the country's top law-enforcement agency as "in tatters," but a white house spokesman said on friday that trump had "full faith and confidence" in the rank-and-file members of the department of justice and the fbi.also on friday morning, hogan gidley, the white house's deputy press secretary, said that recently released fbi records showed "extreme bias" against trump among leadership at the fbi.recently disclosed text messages between two fbi agents assigned to the ongoing investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with trump's campaign included a reference to trump as an "idiot." both agents are no longer involved in the russia investigation. other records revealed edits made to soften the statement of james comey, then the fbi director, concerning the agency's investigation into hillary clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.gidley called the records "eye-opening" and "deeply troubling.""there is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the fbi who were investigating hillary clinton at the time," gidley told "fox & friends" on friday morning.

(ap) — at a press conference early this morning, house speaker paul ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.“donald trump plans to step down as president of the united states and resign from office within the next 30 days,” ryan told reporters. “amid the fury of scandals with russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, trump has also agreed this was for the best.”news of this comes as russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 election have become clearer. in addition to this, the f.b.i. announced yesterday that they have discovered russian property holdings which they believe are owned by trump, gifted to him by russian president vladimir putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.“if the russian holdings do indeed belong to trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” washington analyst tom downey said. “washington insiders say the russian holdings are the main reason that trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.”donald trump took to twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.“we did great things, the best things, but the fake news hates great things! i know you’ll always remember me as the greatest president ever!”“we think this is the best thing,” ryan continued. “he has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. i think trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. vice president pence will make an excellent president and i look forward to working with him in the near future.”after word spread of trump’s impending resignation, newt gingerich, who just this week defended trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.“i think i was very clear with all of my actions that i never supported trump and i plan not to do so in the future as well. i never liked the man, never trusted him. everyone knows that. now mike pence, he’s the president that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. i offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new president.”lloyd glacier, a spokesman for ‘sock it forward‘, a charity started by donald trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with trump’s plan to resign.“this will give trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. and just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.”38-year-old paul horner, a christian mascot who goes by the name fappy the anti-masturbation dolphin, said he is sad to see trump go.“when i’m traveling around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, i see firsthand the progress that donald trump has made in this great christian nation of ours,” horner said. “trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. he was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it’s all gone. it looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the devil is extremely pleased. just an fyi, you’re all going to burn in hell for eternity, but jesus loves you very much! praise fappy!”the trump administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments about trump’s impending resignation. that hotline’s phone number is (785) 273-0329.
0	australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its publicaustralia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public. nbc news predicted that all americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems australia may have already beaten them to it. back in 2010, cbs news reported that the australian government had a potential rfid microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.now, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates rfid microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.under the headline ‘australians embracing super-human microchip technology’, australia’s premier media outlet news.com.au (news corp australia) reports: it may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.shanti korporaal, from sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.she told news.com.au:“you could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or pins it’s the same technology as paypass, so i’m hoping you’ll be able to pay for things with it.”“with opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. any door with a swipe card … it could open your computer, photocopier. loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.”the microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. in her interview with the australian news outlet, shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:“my nana wants one. i’ve had more opposition to my tattoos than i’ve ever had to the chip. my friends are jealous.”in fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called chip my life with her husband, skeeve stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called “super humans.” on the same day this news story broke, shanti appeared at austarlia’s launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game deus ex mankind divided, alongside american implantable technology pioneer amal graafstra.as you can see, the push for rfid microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become “super human,” but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. if you think the elites wouldn’t capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously don’t know history very well.amal graafstra, who became one of the world first rfid implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the us with a prototype of the world’s first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.he’s written a book, spoken at tedx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.in an interview with the australian media outlet, amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has “given me the ability to communicate with machines. it’s literally integrated into who i am.”shanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.ever since watching movies like the terminator, matrix and minority report i wondered if we could actually live like that. i always wondered why we all weren’t living as ‘super-humans’.click to watch: australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public
0	during a monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, white house press secretary sean spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in london and to the families of seven dead u.s. sailors. spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that president donald trump had already appeared on camera on monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the justice department, including special counsel robert mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. he also insisted that trump has the power to fire mueller if necessary. “if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “that is a fact.”asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – spicer argued that the constitution “clearly states” what the president of the united states can and cannot do. “however,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the american society nowadays. one of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. just like our language and many other things that are typically american, our constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. and if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of america, to help it. however, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”spicer continued, “as a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like george washington or thomas jefferson. as a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the constitution was written, donald trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. in other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. for example, president trump not only has the power to fire robert mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the supreme court of the united states as well, should he feel the need for it. and no one could argue with such a decision.”“this is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. to make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just donald trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. it is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. it is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. we need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. that goes especially for interpreting the constitution of the united states,” spicer concluded./politicops.comcommentscomments

0	on sunday, ex-rep. michelle bachmann spoke with breitbart news about the protests outside of a donald trump campaign stop in minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward trump supporters. bachmann argued that president obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the obama position, politically.” she insisted that the president is sending “a signal to donald trump supporters: don’t attend donald trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” she also linked the obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in minneapolis, claiming that obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.“and these days it has become so obvious that i’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “when did this become a nation of criminals? i didn’t get that memo. and if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. you know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the obama administration. i’m not sure what other americans are thinking, but as for me, i feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in america.”the ex-rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “it’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. and yes, african-americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, i’m not going to try to deny that. but one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. that means that there should be no more racial tensions in america at all. and yet, what is our president doing? he’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in minneapolis.”“in fact,” bachmann continued firing, “i don’t think all of the suffering of african-americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative americans in the past 8 years of obama’s presidency.” she added, “because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the supreme court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of america’s major cities. is that the legacy president obama wants to be remembered by? does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? judging by his actions during his presidency, i’m guessing he does.”“and let’s get one thing straight – i’m not just saying this because i happen to be white. no, even if i were asian or hindu or martian, whatever, i’d be saying the same thing all over again,” bachmann quipped. “that’s what i’m trying to point out – white people in america have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that i’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. and that’s just one step away from extinction,” bachmann concluded./politicot.comcommentscomments
0	house speaker paul ryan (r-wi) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the republican health care plan. during an interview that aired on tuesday, fox news host brian kilmeade asked ryan to respond to a recent congressional budget office (cbo) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “what they are basically saying at the congressional budget office, if you’re not going to force people to buy obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the speaker opined. “so, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”kilmeade then asked ryan to comment on the fact that the republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer americans. ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “this is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” ryan said. “i know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? well, i’m sorry brian, but it’s not working. and the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. you’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. that’s not right.”“why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” ryan opined. “the answer is – they shouldn’t. this is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. and that’s the only condition, working hard. if you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. but, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”“being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. so, let me ask you this, brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? if they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy. think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. we’d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. ‘just come on over and become a u.s. citizen – the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don’t even have to get a job.’ that’s preposterous, anyone who thinks that’s a good thing deserves to be poor,” he concluded.

0	fareed zakaria, cnn host of ‘foreign affairs,’ a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in the washington post.zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white middle america by systematically targeting caucasian females.“the white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. while the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.thankfully, the prophet muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. they may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. we may yet see some final convulsions before white middle america is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”the blog post was removed from zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.cnn officials have refused to take action against their employee, stating that there was no evidence of hate speech or racism in zakaria’s writings because he only targeted whites and not minorities. “some people are just being too sensitive,” a cnn representative said in defense of zakaria, adding that “someone’s hurt feelings should not inhibit our right to free speech.”“every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” zakaria posted on his twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.while many have indeed expressed emotional pain and fear after reading his controversial statements, no apology has been heard from zakaria or cnn at the time of this writing.source: redherald
0	following the recent resignation of director of the office of government ethics walter shaub jr., the trump administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: white house chef lisa mead.mead reportedly decided to resign because president donald trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the white house.“it’s kind of crazy because lisa is such a good chef,” said kurt reno, the white house aide who recommended ms. mead for the job. “but lisa feels insulted because the president has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in d.c. the only food-related duty lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the president’s ice cream from the carton.”mr. trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly kentucky fried chicken and mcdonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a white house staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the president’s eating habits to the press.“it’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “the first thing trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. it’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”mr. trump’s mcdonalds habits are even weirder.“he orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “he orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an m&m mcflurry that he has lisa dig out and remove every brown m&m, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra m&m’s. then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the mcflurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. he dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. the sight of this never gets normal. when japanese prime minister shinzo abe saw this routine he threw up.”no wonder chef lisa mead quit. the halfway post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.(photo courtesy of shelby bell.)share this: twitterfacebookgoogle

0	well, well, well…it looks like obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them for) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards.after a breaking story about the scandal hit russian news, multiple sources have confirmed the story. the obama administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. to make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the united states.but that was not what any of this was really about. it never is simple or transparent with the criminal democrats. obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.once again, we’re really sorry that the poor obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a real job because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying americans are over.this is a developing story. please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.

0	the biggest story this week was the arrest of pakistani muslim and longtime aide of debbie wasserman schultz, imran awan. earlier this year, awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. in his attempt to avoid facing justice, awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the dulles international airport. this, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after imran hired his lawyer. the lawyer that was hired to defend imran was no other but a close clinton family associate and lawyer chris gowen.here is more from conservative review:in 2012, gowen went to bat for hillary clinton aide huma abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the muslim brotherhood. after gop reps explored abedin’s nefarious ties, gowen pledged to “stand with huma.”along with his private practice, the longtime clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at american university washington college of law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.gowen’s clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that awan’s employer in the house, rep. debbie wasserman schultz, remains a close clinton confidant. the former democratic national committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the democratic primary in clinton’s favor. wasserman schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of hillary clinton’s first failed run for president.reading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. in fact, abc, nbc, and cbs have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. however, that has not stopped americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting debbie wasserman schultz.now, they are reports that debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since imran’s arrest. also, there are calls for debbie to testify before congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.here is more from conservative fighters:debbie wasserman schultz employed pakistani it staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.imran awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the u.s. after wiring approximately $300,000 to pakistan. fox news is the only cable network covering this huge scandal. when imran awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. his wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.imran and his muslim brothers, abid and jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as it specialists. the three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.word has it that debbie wasserman schultz is an absolute wreck since imran awan was arrested. calls for her to testify to congress are increasingly growing as well.wasserman schultz knows she’s in hot water over this it scandal. the gateway pundit previously reported the fbi seized smashed hard drives belonging to imran awan. we also reported that debbie wasserman schultz threatened the chief of the u.s. capitol police with ‘consequences’ for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a pakistani it staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.it is rather clear in watching the video that debbie wasserman schultz has something to hide. since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the clinton’s?john cardillo reports, ‘florida politicos who have known wasserman schultz for years are telling me she’s a nervous

0	it might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used vick vaporub. it seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.but this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.a mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.when she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. when she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. she imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.she rubbed vick vaporub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. she tucked him up and laid down next to him.she was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.she carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. but, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.the medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.she never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. she only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.the thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. the mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.the label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.sadly, in the case of the mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.we must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.

0	the republican war on women continues unabated. the same week that conservatives argued in the supreme court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, indiana joined the ranks of states like texas and florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. and gov. mike pence recently signed it. the bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, pence argued in an interview with the huffington post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “so, let’s get that straight right away – i oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because i believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. and if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the indiana governor said.“and as if that wasn’t enough,” pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. and that’s bad for a number of reasons. first and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. this is bad, let’s be clear. and that’s part of the reason why i signed this bill, because i believe abortion, or i’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. so indiana is just a step in the right direction.”pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “first and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that i sympathize with rape victims not just in america, but around the world. i can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “however, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. because what would happen? we’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. and that has to be stopped at all cost.”donald trump’s new running mate also said, “basically, if i’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. and you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. that would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. that would be murder. and i’m not a murderer.”“and it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. and there are a lot of crazy people out there. what if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? i mean, indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, i’m telling you. i made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” pence concluded.

0	this is a disaster. in late december, state senator doug ericksen proposed a new law that would give authorities the ability to charge protesters with "economic terrorism," and slap them with serious felony charges that could lead to jail time, just for making their voices heard.the outrageous bill, which has now had been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session, would make any form of protest that causes an "economic disruption" a class c felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. it wouldn't just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as "disruptive." broadly interpreted, this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience.we’ve already hit our initial goal of 50,000 signatures on the petition. but now that the bill has been introduced, we need to get even more people speaking out. if everyone reading this shares the video, we can easily get 100,000 signatures before we deliver it to the washington state lawmakers.charging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the first amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent. please sign the petition telling lawmakers to reject this dangerous legislation.here's the text of the petition:"organizing and participating in protests is a basic constitutional right guaranteed by the first amendment. i urge all lawmakers to reject any legislation that criminalizes protesters or labels protests as a form of "economic terrorism."

0	cnbc reported that trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.donald trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. now, we know that he has ties to the dakota access pipeline, the one that crosses sacred indian land.the construction of the pipeline raised the ire of native american sioux settlements in the area. it will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.the pipeline is also a threat to the missouri and mississippi rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. in addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. the protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.the opposition brought out many supporters, too. on november 15, 2016, there was a national day of action to protest the construction. there were massive protests in cities as los angeles, chicago, denver, and trump’s own manhattan in support of the sioux nation.veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. american heroes supporting native american heroes.and now we learn that “president” trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. no wonder the orange fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.this should come as no surprise since trump ‘s financial ties are everywhere. almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.this involvement is another example of trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. the tenth amendment of the constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. and here it is, another unconstitutional violation.according to ethics experts, trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. as with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.the blind trust would prohibit trump from any involvement. as he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.the dakota pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by trump, but perhaps the most controversial. if only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police.we must insist that the media tell this story. with its broadcast, the public will see how trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.please share this story on facebook!

0	how intolerant can a group of people get, folks?if they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. this should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend muslims? perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both america and european countries if “western culture” offends them so!according to the islamic activist group, hizb-ut-tahrir, australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts islamic beliefs. according to their spokesman, unthman badar, “requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the muslim community.”here’s the pledge:from this time forward, [under god,]i pledge my loyalty to australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs i share,whose rights and liberties i respect, andwhose laws i will uphold and obey.pretty oppressive, right? if you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? here’s the national anthem:australians all let us rejoice,for we are young and free; we’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; our home is girt by sea; our land abounds in nature’s gifts of beauty rich and rare; in history’s page, let every stage advance australia fair. in joyful strains then let us sing, advance australia fair. beneath our radiant southern cross we’ll toil with hearts and hands; to make this commonwealth of ours renowned of all the lands; for those who’ve come across the seas we’ve boundless plains to share; with courage let us all combine to advance australia fair. in joyful strains then let us sing, advance australia fair.super oppressive lyrics, right?if a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.if those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.watch hizb-ut-tahrir spokesman, unthman badar, make the case against muslim school children singing the national anthem. it begins around the 10 minute point.this is outrageous! muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. wqe cannot let them get away with these things!either assimilate, or leave.they are muslim first, last and always. geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. their only loyalty is to allah. it’s their faith. the west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.it irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. how about you go back where your from!! next they will demand that australian’s convert or be beheaded!it makes me sick that our children were denied the american flag under obama, and couldn’t pray… but muslim children can and do.. we are denied christ but they are not denied allah during school hours! this is wrong on more than one level! next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.this what you get with socialist politician bent on destroying their country.do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?
0	“one of the things that the bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the lord’s name in vain. in fact, one of the ten commandments in the old testament states: “you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain, for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (exodus 20:7). the word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”“thus, god was instructing the israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. instead, the israelites were supposed to revere the name of god and use it in a serious, considerate way. many of the ancient israelites were so respectful of the name of god that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written god’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.“dr. john hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the cornerstone church in san antonio, texas, not only agrees with what the good book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. speaking exclusively with newslo, hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”“saying the lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across america,” hagee elaborated. “but, that’s precisely the problem. if the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? follow in their footsteps? i don’t think so. the flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”the pastor reprimanded: “but, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including houses of god, which are the holiest of places.”asked how the situation could be bettered, hagee replied: “well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. if you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using god’s name than women who use it during sex. that is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the lord’s name i can think of. if it were up to me, i would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. that would be a fine example of god’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/commentscomments

0	by free wood posthouston — it seems new national rifle association president (nra) president jim porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water.not long ago he made his feelings about the civil war known when he referred to it as the “war of northern aggression.” in that same speech he referred to president obama as a “fake president” and attorney general eric holder as “rabidly un-american.” however none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the nra.“i’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the nra. we need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our god-given rights. no more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. i will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”when asked to clarify porter said,“i don’t have to clarify. you know gall darn well what i mean. in fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. they sure as hell won’t be our leaders. it’s out-right embarrassing. the war of northern aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. i’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. i don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. it’s our god-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”several at the nra, including vice president wayne lapierre, have since tried to distance themselves from porter’s remarks. lapierre said, “they brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. next time they’d be better off just making me president.”read more!
0	last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of cnn broadcasting porn instead of anthony bourdain’s scheduled show parts unknown. and then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. here are some screenshots grabbed by mediaite.it looks like the chaos all started when the independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the drudge report. after that, it spread fast. mashable, the new york post, the daily mail, esquire, and variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from cnn or rcn, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. the @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on cnn last night. rcn also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. "we are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our cnn network feed was compromised last evening in boston," jeff carlson, svp and general manager of rcn boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.cnn has also released a statement: “the rcn cable operator in boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on cnn last night. cnn has asked for an explanation.” but that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.@solikearose 800-746-4726. we have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on cnn in boston. if you're still having an — rcn (@rcnconnects) november 25, 2016@solikearose issue with that channel, please dm us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. thanks, melissa — rcn (@rcnconnects) november 25, 2016the appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. hilarious! and the cnn program that was supposed to be on was anthony bourdain: parts unknown. it’s a layup for body-part puns.this is exactly how fake news spreadsbut this is exactly how fake news spreads. even if porn was aired on cnn, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. many of the headlines already implicate cnn, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.the stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.
0	the recently installed ceo of donald trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. according to politico, breitbart news chairman stephen bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a january 1996 incident in the couple’s southern california home.“i was wondering when this would come up,” bannon told politico. “it’s been a while and given my current position at the head of donald trump’s campaign, i was curious to see how long it would take the democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. and while we’re on the subject, i’m actually disappointed; i honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? i mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. and the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, i mean, it’s just ridiculous. why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, donald trump as well? it’s so obvious i honestly find it hilarious.”but, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, bannon said, “alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. and just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. as a matter of fact, i’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and i don’t mean that in everyday life. i’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.“so, that’s why i find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that i’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” bannon added. “because, god made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. and one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. and i loved my ex wife, i loved her dearly. i loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as i love my twins to this day.”“and when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, i don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘i do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. at no point did i exceed my marital liberties, so why should i, or worse, why should donald trump be punished for it?” he concluded.source:politicops.comcommentscomments

0	after trump made it clear that obama had illegally tapped the phones at trump tower, the fbi issued a warrant for his arrest. since then, little has been heard from the former president other than a denial.this morning, obama was stopped at a checkpoint at toronto international airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “bruce wilekenmeyer.” the crmp officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the us embassy.after a short transport back to washington, obama was brought before a special session of us district court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney’s custody.a court reporter who also moonlights for breitbart took great personal risk to snap this photo since there are no photographs, video recording or any other recording devices allowed in federal courtrooms unless specifically ordered by a judge:as you can see, he had also died the gray in his hair to help mask his appearance. it didn’t work. share this and make sure everyone knows that the traitor was caught and will answer for his crimes!!!

0	when donald trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states, it was at a time when europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. isis was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the paris bombings, or even the german priest that was beheaded for being a christian–they all were fueled by islam. people need to understand that islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the united states.a georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional muslim veils.state rep. jason spencer (r) filed legislation on wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. the measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about islamic terrorism. spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.“this bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of islamic terrorism, and we in the state of georgia do not want our laws used against us,” spencer told wsb-tv in atlanta.many people will immediately read this and argue that the first amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. our constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.here is the problem: islam is not a religion. it is a cancerous disease that calls for all christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god allah. a vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of allah. when was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the bible?quran 8:12: i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. quran 9:29: fight against those who believe not in allah, nor in the last day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. islam) among the people of the scripture (jews and christians), until they pay the jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.fight against those who believe not in allah, nor in the last day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. islam) among the people of the scripture (jews and christians), until they pay the jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. quran 3:151: soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, for that they joined companions with allah, for which he had sent no authority.is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?just for starters, liberals already banned school prayer because christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different?there is a difference between a hijab and burqa. spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.while liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the united states. outside of georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.the threat of islam and those that practice it are so severe that france and belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. local governments in italy, spain, and switzerland have also instituted bans.

you see, i had a sister who attended spelman college and four other male cousins who attended clark. the last thing i needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. that would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.i eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. we loaded up into my friends ford explorer and headed over to a club called traxx. apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in atlanta attended on saturday. i remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. it was huge! there had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. because we were underage, we couldn’t drink. apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. after awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. clubs aren’t as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. while standing on the side i noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. he was very attractive, and every time i would catch him looking in my direction i would look the other way. this entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so i didn’t know what to take his stares for. eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. he told me that i looked familiar, and asked me where i was from. i told him that i was from charlotte north carolina, and i couldn’t possibly look familiar. i had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. he asked me why i wasn’t drinking, and i told him we couldn’t buy drinks because we were all under 21. he offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. i jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. after all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.he returned minutes later with three drinks. the drinks he ordered for us were long island iced teas. i remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. it was very strong. rather than be rude and waste his money, i drank it slowly. stephawn then asked why i was babysitting my drink. i asked what did he mean by that, because i had never heard the phrase used before. he told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. by the time the second round came, i was feeling nice. we continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.after the third round i was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. after awhile my friends wanted to leave, and i told him that i would catch up with him later. he asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. i ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.we ended up leaving the club an hour later. while taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on e. we pulled into an apartment complex in the lindbergh area of buckhead. he told me to come up with him so i did. as soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. we eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. he started unbuckling my my pants, and i stopped him. i confessed that i was a virgin and didn’t have a clue what i was doing.he told me to relax, and that everything was cool. he said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. he made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. then he took my pants off. i was tense and nervous. i didn’t know what to expect, but he was so attractive i wanted every ounce of this man. the first thing he did was start eating my ass and i moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. next he started sucking my d***k from the back while i was laying on my stomach. it felt amazing. i wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. he grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. he rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. he slowly put his finger inside of my ass. i moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. after awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. i immediately stopped him! i asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? i said because i didn’t come to atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. he ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and i said that’s cool but we just met. if we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. he jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. i watched him put the condom on, and then i buried my face into the pillow. it was painful at first. i didn’t understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. i had to stop him several times, because i could not take the pain. after about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. i couldn’t take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. i didn’t want to disappoint him, and i didn’t want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. i decided to “man up” and squirted some more lube on my ass. i laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. he inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didn’t hurt as much. he started to increase his stroke, and i had no problem taking it. he was grabbing my waist, and i attempted to throw my ass back like i had seen in the porno movies. whatever i was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. after 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. as he came i felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. i jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! i screamed what happened to the condom? he grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. there was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. i ran to the bathroom, because it felt like i had to s***t. when i used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. it was allot. i kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. that was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because i watched him put the condom on.i came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. i said nigga i just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. i asked him if he took the f***king condom off. he said no. he said that it must have broke. i wasn’t buying it, and i searched around for the condom. i found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. the condom wasn’t broke at all! i rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. i screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isn’t broken. he told me that i was tripping, and i ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. i filled the condom with water and it didn’t leak at all! when i did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. i felt betrayed, i was scared for my life, and i was hurt. i had heard about atlanta being one of the cities with the highest aids rates in the country, and i was determined not to be a statistic.i got my things, and got out of his house. this asshole didn’t even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. as i waited outside of his apartments in the cold, i called a cab service. they arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. the entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. i didn’t answer his calls, because i didn’t want to talk to him. i was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. there was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. i know some guys get off by that, but i was disgusted by it.the thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. as the liquor wore off, i went into a deep depression. when i got to my dorm, i popped two tylenol pm’s and fell alseep.i didn’t tell anyone about my experience. how could i explain that i had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. i had just met this man. i didn’t even know his real name. when my friends asked me what happened, i said nothing and gave them a look that said “don’t ask me anymore questions!”. they didn’t ask, and i didn’t tell. that experience frightened me so bad that i decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. that meant pulling back from my “gay friends” too, because i was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. i started hanging more with my straight friends. after all, i had to keep my charade up. i had family that attended my school, so i couldn’t be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.8 months later while home for christmas break i had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. this was something my mother made me do ever year since i can remember. my doctor asked me was i sexually active, and i said no. i told him that i had sex once, but that was it. i wasn’t sexually active, because i wasn’t actively having sex. he told me that he was going to include an hiv test in my regular blood work anyway. a few days later i received a call from his office. it wasn’t the doctor, it was one of the office workers. she was obviously new, because i didn’t recognize her voice. she told me that i needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. i was confused. i asked her what “something” was, and she said that she couldn’t release this information over the phone and that i should come in today. this was very unusual, because i had never had this happen before and i had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. at first i thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. there was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. i borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctor’s office. i didn’t want to scare her, so i didn’t mention what i was borrowing the car for.i will never forget what happened next. as i arrived to my doctor’s office, i was told to have a seat in the waiting room. there was soft music playing that turned out to be barry manilow’s daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! i hated that f***king song. i was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when i was being called into my doctor’s office to discuss my lab results. before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. it was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. brighter than usual. he began to look over my charts and lab results. he grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said i’m sorry to have to tell you this, but your hiv resultscame back positive. i swear i didn’t even hear the word positive, i just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. i said, i’m sorry but there must be some mistake. i am not sexually active. i’ve only had sex once! i haven’t had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. he said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.i thought about committing suicide. i could not eat. i could not sleep. i could not focus on school. i couldn’t do anything but cry. my doctor couldn’t legally tell my mother i was hiv positive, but i was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the hiv meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. i tried to get in contact with stephawn but his number was disconnected.when i got back to school, i went over to the apartment complex where he lived but i couldn’t remember the apartment number. i had no way of reaching this guy. i wanted to kill him, and i was going to. i had a butcher knife and i was going to stab him thru the heart, because i knew this guy had given me hiv, because i didn’t have sex with anyone else. as time passed, i became so depressed that i eventually dropped out of school. i kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when i’m going to die soon. i lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. i decided to drop out of school, because i didn’t know how to deal with it all. i had no one to turn to. i couldn’t tell my friends, and i couldn’t tell my parents. can you imagine telling your mother that you are hiv positive after a one night stand. i couldn’t dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.today i read the article about isaac burks and saw his picture. this is the same guy who told me his name was stephawn. this is the guy that gave me hiv! he ruined my life. i finally ended up telling my parents because i could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. my mother didn’t cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. later on that night as i got up to use the bathroom i heard her crying in her room. tears immediately started pouring down my face and i ran to the kitchen. i slit my wrist. i wanted to die. i fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. i have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. accepting the fact that i am hiv positive has been very hard. i still have not been able to return to school, and i have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.to the sick f***k isaac burks, also known as stephawn who gave me hiv, i hope you rott in hell. now that i know his real name i will contact the authorities and tell my story. every day i hope that things will get better, and it doesn’t. i ask “why me?” every day. what did i do to deserve this? i have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. i just know the minute i tell them my hiv status they will be out of the door. i am going to die alone. the last time i tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills i woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. but i cant. i have nothing to live for. i am alive, but i am not living.i cried as i typed this post. i relived it, but felt i had to share my story. after finally coming out to my friends with my story i later found out that there were others that this man infected with hiv.read isaac don burks response on his facebook page below:isaac don burks facebook pagei can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading hiv to hundreds of people. i would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around, but i have a life to live. i have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner. i am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life. i have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my best-friend to this at such a young age. it baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story. loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous. im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie cannot win. see sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster. i pray for you whoever you are. see my god doesn’t allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent. i can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. satan get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper!!!!! for the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u wwjd, what if this was you or your brother, uncle, cousin, farther. i’m not madd because i know who i am and im better then this. when your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want. i dont have anyhing else really to say besides god bless you all

0	a string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. after a reporter for the washington examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of clinton attorney vince foster. foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..with new evidence, rep. trey gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of vince foster exhumed for autopsy. the body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. forensic specialists examined the body last night at the naval hospital in norfolk, virginia, concluding that the cause of death for mr. foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..lt col. james mcfitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. there would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. the wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..the doctor who signed foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. without the letter from the reporter, mr. foster may have never seen justice..the case has been turned over to the fbi, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from foster’s death directly to bill and hillary clinton. director comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau’s resources are made available..in other words, clinton will be getting away with murder…again.
0	doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murderednagalese prevents vitamin d being produced in the bodyneon nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors being murdered, most of which were in florida, u.s.these scientists all shared a common trait; they had all discovered that nagalase enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then administrated to humans.nagalese is what prevents vitamin d from being produced in the body, which is the body's main defense to naturally kill cancer cells.(scroll down for video)according to thebigriddle.com: nagalase is a protein that's also created by all cancer cells. this protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. and they're putting it in our vaccines!!this prevents the body from utilizing the vitamin d necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. nagalese disables the immune system. it's also known to cause type 2 diabetes. so basically…they weren't killing these doctors because they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating autism… they're killing them because these dr's had been researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they're injecting our precious children with are causing our current cancer and autism crisis!!and that it's obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! the dr's they killed in fl had been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the information.depopulation 101..add poison to vaccines…make it law that all children must be injected to attend school. slow kill methods. they think they're being fair w/ their "survival of the fittest" type mentality. only the best genes survive? these people have no souls.

0	need more proof that liberalism is a disease? two united states representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of president trump. these aren’t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they’re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.rep. harold spunkmeyer (d-illinois) and rep. johnathon leominster jr (d-massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the president. several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. as we speak, a special unit of the secret service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to president trump.according to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men’s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. it’s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:“their plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a ‘design for a new video game,’” said special agent george ketterman, “while they never actually used the president’s name or purchased any of the items listed in the ‘game,’ like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.”in unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. abc reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing trump’s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in washington.nbc news tried to reach out to the men’s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn’t find one. it would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the patriot act.welcome to trump’s america, liberals. if you step out of line you’ll be removed altogether.
0	donald trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. if you doubt that donald trump is god’s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some evangelical leaders. mary colbert for one, is certain of this:“it’s not that donald trump is all that perfect of a guy. we all know he’s not. and we know that he’s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. that’s not how god works. he works through the ones he chooses. we don’t choose them.”“all we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they’ve been chosen and know that that’s the will of god, then your life will be blessed. and if you come against the chosen one of god, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children’s children curses like you have never seen. it puts a holy fear in me.evangelist kenneth copeland echoes mary colbert’s warning, and fleshes out how god will mete out punishment for not supporting president trump, when he appeared on the trinity broadcasting network last year:“if christians don’t support trump, they are risking the wrath of god. trump has been chosen by god, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting god. they could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.”copeland appeared on colbert’s “pray for america” call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.
0	recently, republican ohio gov. john kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. at the same time, kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”“at the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” kasich told the ohio daily star. “women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, i’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. the women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”he continued, “our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. today, the situation is so critical that i honestly fear for the future of this country. and so, i was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so i did. and there’s one very simple reason why i did it. that’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”“a woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? to literally force them to commit manslaughter?” kasich said. “i don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but i for one am not comfortable with that one bit. and so i reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”“and i’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of ohio will have to be approved by the state. that means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. and in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.source:newslo.com

0	a 32-year old tampa local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to ‘fill a scuba tank with weed smoke’ failed spectacularly last night. according to the testimony of several witnesses, darren winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.“darren’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “for some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. his plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”mr winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in ybor, telling them he’d finally perfected what he called his ‘scuba bong’. “clearly it wasn’t a bong at all,” pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, “but he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.”when his friends assembled at mr winter’s residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. “he’d had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his ‘scuba bong’ up and running.” with his friends present, mr winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. this is the point that everything went horribly wrong.according to the witnesses, mr winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. “the tank basically exploded after [winters] knocked it over,” commented one of the witnesses. none of winter’s friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.winter’s friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. his condition has now been downgraded from ‘critical’ to ‘serious’, but medical staff announced they’d been unable to save his testicles which had been ‘cleanly severed’ by a shard of metal.preliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by winters may be banned from dive use throughout the us. “this tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing,” commented the lead investigator on the case. “we regularly audit dive shops in tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. if [winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.”this news will be little comfort to mr winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. the young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. “he’s one of the toughest guys i know,” commented one of mr winter’s friends. “he’ll take the fact he won’t be able to have kids pretty hard, though.”correction: an earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. mr winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a tampa pizza restaurant. we regret the error.in other news making headlines, a 68-year old man from decatur in northern alabama has discovered that his new bride is actually his own grand-daughter. the couple have no plans to divorce.

0	costa mesa, ca. – gop presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur donald trump on thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster america’s armed forces. “we’re bringing back the draft, okay? we’re going to bring it back and were going to make america as strong as we were in the sixties,” trump declared while addressing supporters at the pacific amphitheater in costa mesa.“i love the sixties,” said trump, continuing, “i was a very big supporter of the vietnam war and, of course, the troops. no one supports the troops more than i do.” in addition to bringing back military conscription, mr. trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “you have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. we’re not going to give it to them, folks. they’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the islamic state. on thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by american soldiers on the battlefield. “we’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the united states, trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “my feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”the former reality tv star accused president obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “this guy’s the president of the united states and he’s bowing to the chinese. they’re laughing in our faces, okay? they’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”donald trump kicked off the start of his california campaign on thursday where he made a stop in costa mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in orange county. the gop presidential hopeful is scheduled to address california’s republican convention on friday.
0	president donald trump was very active on twitter easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldn’t have to show them since he “easily won the electoral college.” moments after he defended no longer calling china a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with north korea, trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on twitter. “i did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a republican-easily won the electoral college! now tax returns are brought up again?” trump tweeted.as always, his son eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. during an brief phone interview with kyxl radio based out of orlando, florida, president trump’s second son argued that his father’s tax return is “irrelevant,” largely because “he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.” he said, “when you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.”eric continued, “and while we’re on the subject, i kind of have to say, it’s funny how taxes work. they sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. that’s kind of not fair. what he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. the worst part is, i’m not saying something that’s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. my father, regardless of the fact that he’s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. that’s a catastrophe.”the self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to “fix” the broken tax system of the united states. “at the end of the day, it’s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. it won’t matter soon anyway,” eric argued. asked to elaborate, he said that president trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that “cancels taxes for extra productive people in the u.s. economy.” “it’s our way of saying ‘good job’ to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. it is to them that this country owes its gratitude. they are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.”“as for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, i can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. this is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn’t have to pay tax; like i said, it’s a sort of ‘thank you’ from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working americans who have done their duties thus far. as for the rest, i guess they’ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. no more freeloaders, that’s where we’re going with this. bottom line, if you’ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. and you’re going to have to pretty soon,” eric concluded.
0	the pro-life movement in the usa have stated that they believe that human life starts at the moment of conception and so the human fetus can be considered a human being, and hence they should have their rights to live.recently, another argument broke out last month which has created a huge debate regarding abortion. different religious groups have different views on this topic. pro-lifers have stated that they believe that ejaculation is equivalent to murder and there should be laws to stop that.rachel stratt, a pro-life activist commented that conception is the starting point of life, and that is why they don't believe in birth control. according to them, semen has been provided by the almighty for a particular purpose to seed life and wasting it is simply showing your disrespect towards god. they believe that every sperm cell is life, and ejaculation means killing all those babies.the pro-life protesters are now asking the government to make a law which would make ejaculating for own gratification illegal throughout the usa. so many lives are lost only because men ejaculate watching p0rn videos on adult sites like pornhub just to satisfy themselves. this is murder, there is an urgent need to protect the sperms, and the babies.in fact, a petition was submitted on change.org stating that sperm wastage due to self-satisfaction should be made illegal, and it has already received over 85,000 signatures. it needs another 15,000 signatures before the white house will be reviewing it. 38 women who are in the white house reported that this bill would be passed if that opportunity ever arises.

"you know the rules and so do i. a full commitment's what i'm thinking of," rowlinson said. "you wouldn't get this from any other guy," he added, shaking his head.in california, where facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.courts in the us had earlier blocked trump's travel ban executive order.keen on supporting the president, vice president mike pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by trump.reacting to this proposed order, facebook co-founder and ceo mark zuckerberg said that facebook will continue to run its operations from california even if the site is banned in the us.on trump's claim to fight fake news, zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.last month, reports were saying that a court in pakistan was mulling action against facebook over 'blasphemous content'.lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. if trump's executive order is passed, us will join the list of those countries.employees of facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.donald trump's remarks on facebook and zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

0	during a time when the republican party’s presumptive nominee, donald trump, should be working to bring the party together and prepare for the primary battle against hillary clinton, he continues to deepen the divide between republicans and americans alike.trump’s recent attack on u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel because of his mexican-american background prompted sen. lindsey graham to round up the republicans who have previously endorsed donald trump, and persuade them to take it all back.graham claimed that trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-american thing from a politician since joe mccarthy.”“if anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” graham told the new york times.”senator graham elaborated on this during an interview with nbc news’ hallie jackson.“there are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the republican party, including me,” he said. “but there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and i would like to support our nominee. i just can’t.”donald trump claimed that judge gonzalo curiel, who is presiding over the trump university case, has been biased toward him because of his latino heritage.“i couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said sunday.“those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” rep. susan collins (r-maine) said to news radio wgan. “they are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why i think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the constitution.”although many republicans, including house speaker paul ryan, have condemned trump’s accusations, they continue to support him.

0	as we know, clinton foundation has been given an a+ as a charitable organization. it slightly made more reputable than the red cross. now, it has been ordered to cease operations. chelsea clinton, the ceo, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. but, following this news, clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.the reason behind the shutdown is the alleged ‘’pay for play’’ donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to washington dc in exchange for cash. during clinton’s time as secretary of state, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with obama bin laden were all invited to the white house residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of scattergories. then, the creator of isis, osama bin laden was sent to cheyenne mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while obama and clinton staged his death.so, it all comes down to how chelsea clinton used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents. doug band, formerly a top aide to president bill clinton, griped about the former first daughter’s spending in a jan.4, 2012, email released by wikileaks.“the investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents…,” band wrote to john podesta, now hillary clinton’s campaign chairman.“i hope that you will speak to her and end this. once we go down this road…”a chain of emails was hacked from podesta’s gmail account and wikileaks has released more that 50,000 of the stolen emails over the past 32 days.

0	mike pence said he didn’t understand why michelle obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, donald trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. the first lady denounced the republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”“first and foremost,” pence argued, “i have no idea why mrs. obama, who will be departing the white house shortly, is even commenting on the future president of the united states, god-willing. that’s the first thing i don’t quite get. secondly, if she’s the first lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that first ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? what’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? that’s not what she should be doing.”the governor of indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “now, i know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “if she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”he continued, “if we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. but no, michelle obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. and she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. she can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool donald trump or any other conservative american who has the guts to think for himself.”“how many times do i have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” pence asked. “he has apologized for it several times, and i really don’t know what else people want him to do. and now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the new york times who are calling donald a sexual predator. and as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. that’s just ridiculous.”“there is no way in hell michelle obama isn’t working with the new york times in a joint effort to smear the good name of donald trump, if you ask me. i refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that donald trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. this is too well organized to be an accident. and the entire democratic party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady michelle obama. and i’m actually glad that’s the case because when donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” pence concluded.
0	anonymous sources within the fbi have revealed to the times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for donald trump is an agent of the fsb (formerly the kgb). an unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.the allegation that 62 million americans appear to be employed by russian intelligence services has rocked the bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds – literally.this shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that russia did wikileaks because donald trump personally called vladimir putin and asked him to. it was also revealed earlier this week that alex jones (real name “alexi jonesinov”) is a russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the fsb (formerly the kgb) to post news articles on the internet saying that donald trump would be a good president.however, the revelation that 62 million americans are taking orders directly from the kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which fbi agents are struggling with how to deal with.it was determined by puerto rican federal judge mizu tomazaki that it is a crime to support donald trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges weinberg, steinman and goldenstein upheld the ruling. despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.it may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the fsb (formerly the kgb), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“we have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for trump was paid directly by the kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in st. petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “russian neuro-brain hacking.”this method was developed by the kgb, which became the fsb following the fall of the ussr.what we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for donald trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by russian agents from the fsb (formerly the kgb).“if people were not beholden to russia, they would have voted for hillary clinton,” a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by crowdstrike, a contractor hired by the dnc to investigate russian space-beam mind control.when asked for comment on these reports by the times, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the fsb (formerly the kgb) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.”senator chuck schumer called the response from peskov “predictable,” adding, “what do you expect from the criminal putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the ukraine, murdered innocent syrians and hacked our elections by controlling people’s brains with a space-beam?”upon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million american voters are working directly for russia, senator john mccain has called for mass arrests. he referred to all trump voters as “radical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights,” and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to syrian refugees.together we will make america great again!
0	workers in new orleans dismantled the city’s jefferson davis monument early thursday, removing the prominent statue of the confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.as workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving confederate flags.“this historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” mayor mitch landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of confederacy-related monuments.the mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th president barack obama.“it will be nice”, landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first african-american president in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist white privilege.”the obama statue will be patterned after one erected in kenya last year and will reportedly cost the louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.beaureguard billy-bob johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“we would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. and i really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. barricades were used to keep the sides separated, nola.com reported. the news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “where’s mitch?” while opponents chanted, “hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”as fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of black lives matter leaders.
0	seth rich seth rich- editor's note (5/17/17): we want to update you on a story you first saw on fox 5 dc. we want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by rod wheeler, the private investigator hired by seth rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.what he told fox 5 dc on camera monday regarding seth rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. rod wheeler has since backtracked.in an interview monday, wheeler told fox 5 dc he had sources at the fbi confirming there was evidence of communication between seth rich and wikileaks. this is the verbatim of that exchange:fox 5 dc: “you have sources at the fbi saying that there is information...”wheeler: "for sure..."fox 5 dc: “...that could link seth rich to wikileaks?"wheeler: "absolutely. yeah. that's confirmed."in the past 48 hours, rod wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from fbi sources, contradicting what he told us on monday.since rod wheeler backtracked tuesday, fox 5 dc attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.on wednesday, just before our newscast, wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as "miscommunication."when asked if wheeler is still working for seth rich's family, wheeler told fox 5 dc the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.we reached out once again to the rich family, and through a spokesperson the rich family tells fox 5 dc, "the family has relayed their deep disappointment with rod wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family."-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------original story:it has been almost a year since democratic national committee staffer seth rich was murdered in the nation's capital. there have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.rich was shot and killed last july in northwest d.c and police have suggested the killing in the district's bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. however, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to rich's work at the dnc.just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of rich's death, fox 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.rod wheeler, a private investigator hired by the rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with wikileaks prior to his death. wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the rich family tuesday which also includes that "the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family."now, questions have been raised on why d.c. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.wheeler, a former d.c. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into rich’s murder. he said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation."the police department nor the fbi have been forthcoming,” said wheeler. “they haven't been cooperating at all. i believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which i believe is either at the police department or either at the fbi. i have been told both.”when we asked wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links rich to wikileaks, he said, “absolutely. yeah. that's confirmed."wheeler also told us, "i have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘rod, we were told to stand down on this case and i can’t share any information with you.’ now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. again, i don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but i do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the dnc and that is the information that will come out [tuesday].wheeler told fox 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.fox 5's melanie alnwick spoke with d.c. police on tuesday and was told that wheeler’s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the rich case was false.the family sent alnwick a statement on tuesday with the following statement:"as we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. we are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seth's murderers. the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family."previous coverage on

0	fresh off his gaffe involving president andrew jackson and the civil war, donald trump has made yet another historical faux pas regarding the “war of northern aggression.” in an interview with the red shtick, trump regaled us with his other thoughts on the war that an angry jackson totally saw coming.trump has been struggling to defend his comments — widely deemed preposterous, even by st. landry parish educational standards — in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves would’ve found a way to prevent the civil war.the donald, a member of the party of lincoln, elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first democratic u.s. president, who died 16 years before the civil war, would have managed to avoid a war the first republican president could not.trump, a noted fan of kentucky fried chicken, explained how col. sanders took five loaves of evangeline maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.speaking to our intern dave robicheaux, who is paid in facebook likes, trump insisted col. harland sanders, whom he called a “tremendous civil war hero,” once saved an entire army at valley forge from certain starvation. trump, a noted fan of kentucky fried chicken, explained how col. sanders took five loaves of evangeline maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.robicheaux attempted to explain to trump that col. sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that the donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a biblical story about jesus feeding the multitudes, and that valley forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the civil war.upon being confronted with these facts, the donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a confederate monument removal protest in new orleans while screaming about fake news.church’s chicken and popeye’s louisiana kitchen were unavailable for comment.incidentally, trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies’ restaurants if they don’t share their respective secret recipes with him.the red shtick will update this story as new attacks from the white house on history and our deep-fried way of life develop.what do you think of this shtick?
0	we all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. we might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.if you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, nasa might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. but it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.nasa has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “rest studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 usd. during the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, skype and smoke weed. they can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 usd per week.so what is the exact purpose of these studies?these studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.the rest study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.this study is designed to achieve three core tasks:examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.the study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.the exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.the entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. but once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. for 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! you’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.during the study, nasa will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.but is it worth it?you may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. at some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.this will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.
0	here is what will happen if the deep state takes down president trump & it’s not pretty … for them“the tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – thomas jeffersonelder patriot – corrupt politicians ignore jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. it’s no longer political, it’s personal.americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of donald trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the freedom movement genie back in the bottle.conservative senator ted cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with donald trump during the republican primary process nevertheless embraced trump’s america first agenda and said, “if we’re given the white house and both houses of congress and we don’t deliver, i think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. and i think quite rightly.”candidate trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. what, among those promises, should any republican, nay any american, have a problem with?after four months without a single legislative achievement, congressional and senatorial republicans – notably john mccain, paul ryan and lindsey graham – have joined the democrats in investigating president trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.so, what gives?well, there was one additional promise that trump made on his way to the white house that has some republicans joining with democrats and quaking in their boots, trump’s promise to “drain the swamp.”as we reported yesterday, “an f.b.i. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”the criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. it should be noted that the democratic party has already done this once before.one hundred and fifty-seven years ago the democrats waged a war against the first republican president abraham lincoln for giving blacks their freedom. that war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 americans died fighting for what they believe in. to put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the revolution through vietnam.today, americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s god-given freedoms. despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. no, the americans that back donald trump are well armed.donald trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and nra members, move it forward by force.these patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. they have grown disgusted by the corruption in washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure trump’s freedom agenda moves forward and under the direction of donald trump himself.no amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. the battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.so why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of america that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of making america great again? it’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the american taxpayers.and, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the u.s. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. it’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. buckle your chin strap, america is counting on you.editors note: this is not a call to arms but rather an analysis of what would happen if the deep states overturns a duely elected president.here is a list of every single time obama committed an impeachable offense that dems & media covered up“impeach!” it’s been more than eight years since democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during president obama’s administration – but now that president trump is the man in the white house, it’s back with a vengeance.democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “i” word, hoping to nail trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the new york times claimed a memo written by former fbi director james comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn.some members of congress are getting in on the action. they include reps. maxine water, d-calif., and al green, d-texas. even a republican, rep. justin amash, claimed wednesday there are grounds to impeach president trump. house oversign committee chair rep. jason chaffetz, r-utah, asked for the alleged comey memo and other documents. chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. and sen. john mccain, r-ariz., invoked “watergate.”now the democratic party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. more than 1 million people signed a petition calling on congress to impeach trump.wasting no time wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. msnbc launched a watergate ad implying trump is america’s new richard nixon.“watergate. we know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says msnbc host chris hayes, who hinted that trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “now, who knows where the questions will take us. but i know this: i’m not going to stop asking them.”meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around washington, d.c., demanding all white house staffers resign wednesday.the posters read: “if you work for this white house you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. also, any wars will be on your soul. … resign now.”but constitutional scholar jonathan turley, who voted for president obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with president trump. why?at this time, there’s no evidence trump actually committed a crime.“the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo,” turley wrote in a may 17 opinion piece posted at the hill. turley explained:for the first time, the comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding trump into the scope of the united states criminal code.however, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. not surprising, within minutes of the new york times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. but this memo is neither the pentagon papers nor the watergate tapes. indeed, it raises as many questions for comey as it does trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.a good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 u.s.c. 1503. the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo. there are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. none would fit this case. that leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”however, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. the term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.. obama’s iran nuke dealobama knew about hillary’s private email serverobama irs targets conservativesobama’s doj

0	according to guerilla:obama canceled it, trump reinstated it – a very sacred day is back.obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. not anymore.president trump made barack obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.trump told the crowd:“police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. that changes today. americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the black lives matter movement wouldn’t be offended. apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.president trump has righted that wrong once and for all. if the black lives matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. the families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.what do you think about this?share this post and leave your comment below ‘way to go mr. president’.like our page on facebook.note: we at uspostman cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.source: guerilla
0	president donald trump has finally given congress the authorization to pursue charges against hillary clinton.jason chaffetz, the chairman of the united states house committee on oversight and government reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with president trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. chaffetz also hinted that charges against hillary could be happening soon.here is what chaffetz said:“president trump visited philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. i went backstage with the president. here’s what he said: ‘you do a great job. listen, i understand i’m the president and you have a job. you do the oversight. don’t slow down. go after everything you want to go after. you look at everything you want to look at.’ if you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. and for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ i think was a good message.”watch:the news that president trump supports the investigation comes just days after the oversight committee ordered james comey, (now former) fbi director, to release the contents of hillary clinton’s email server. this means that the lawless and reckless behavior of hillary clinton hasn’t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.without obama and comey to cover her back now, hillary clinton may finally be indicted. it’s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. she has to answer for that, and now that president trump is in control, she won’t make it out of this investigation so easily.what do you think about this? share this on facebook or twitter scroll down for more
0	at a campaign town hall event at st. anselm college in new hampshire, sen. marco rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on hillary clinton, claiming she is the one with “radical” positions. perhaps trying to show rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the democrat frontrunner.“i don’t know what you’re talking – i believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. that’s what i believe,” declared rubio. rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. “i believe it is outrageous that hillary clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that’s been outlawed in the united states, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,” rubio asserted.taking another question from the audience, rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would “put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.”“i’m just totally against the whole shebang, i won’t deny it,” rubio said. “i am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. i mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.”he added: “that is why i believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. however, i also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.”asked how soon such a plan could be put in action, rubio replied: “don’t know yet, first thing’s first here. i need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.”/sourcecommentscomments

0	the announcement that mall of america was welcoming its first black santa claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. three years after fox’s megyn kelly definitively explained to america that both jesus christ and santa claus were white men, mall of america dismissed her advice and hired larry jefferson, a retired u.s. army veteran from irving, texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of alaska, sarah palin. the sharp-tongued republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running mall of america into the ground,” on the basis of santa “always having been white in the bible.” “no, i refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, i thought the company had some backbone but i guess i was wrong,” palin told the minneapolis star-tribune.she also argued that hiring a non-white santa claus was “the last straw” in corporate america’s twisting of traditional, conservative christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” she added, “that’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. but, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional christian values, just so they could make more money. i understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but i don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“that’s why americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” palin added. “the holy book always said santa claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. and we need to make an example out of mall of america. if we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having arab santa clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make ieds out of christmas lights. i mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white christianity. the numbers of converts to islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. we are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.

0	edward snowden: osama bin laden is still alive living in the bahamas:edward snowden (the nsa whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. he apparently has documents that prove osama bin laden is on the cia’s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the bahamas.in 2013, edward snowden, a former contractor for the national security agency (nsa), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. this resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.all of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by u.s. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.he currently resides in russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. the moscow tribune reports that snowden claims that osama bin laden the infamous former leader of al qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the central intelligence agency (cia).“i have documents showing that bin laden is still on the cia’s payroll,” snowden claims. “he is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his nassau bank account. i am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”snowden claims the cia faked the death of osama bin laden. after reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the bahamas.“osama bin laden was one of the cia’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” snowden claims. “what kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the seals kill him? they organized his fake death with the collaboration of the pakistani secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”naijapicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.despite the fact snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of america by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the usa. this is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for snowden to be pardoned. this was rejected by the white house rejected on july 28, 2015.whilst resident in hong kong, snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. he was asked why he left his own country, his reply to the guardian was:“i don’t want to live in a society that does these sort of things… i do not want to live in a world where everything i do and say is recorded.”source : unknown but not hidden; image source: awareness act

0	the dea just raided the vacation ranch of democrat senator hal lindsay (d-nj), seizing more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product. the ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.the bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. all in all, senator lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. he was taken into custody at his office in washington dc and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail.lindsay’s office isn’t commenting on the ordeal but new jersey governor chris christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible. the loss of yet another seat, especially in the northeast, would be devastating to the democrats.the dea says their investigation isn’t over and that there are potentially more politicians involved. we’ll keep you updated.
0	there have been many reports about the changes our planet earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didn’t really pan out, making us question everything we read on the internet. but this time, nasa confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in november 2017 starting from november 15 to november 29.nasa reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn’t know exactly when. upon more detailed examination the astronomers from nasa confirmed that the phenomenon will start on november 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until november 30, 4:45 pm.images (4).jpgaccording to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between jupiter and venus. there was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by charles bolden, head of nasa explaining the strange event to officials at the white house.according to the report, during this specific period jupiter and venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. venus will move to the south-west of jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than jupiter. venus’ bright light will heat up the gases in jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. this reaction will come in contact with our sun at 2:50 am on november 15th.once the hydrogen reaches the sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. the whole process will generate so much heat that the sun will change its color into a bluish shade. once this happens, the sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.as a result of this strange phenomenon, the sun’s light will be seen much dimmer from the earth and hence the 15-day blackout nasa is talking about.“we do not expect any major effects from the blackout event. the only effect this event will have on earth is an increase of 6 – 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. no one should worry much. this event would be similar to what alaskans experience in the winter”, bolden said.
0	maxine waters (d-ca) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. she is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. she has pushed the lie about president trump having russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the white house for.now the demented democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “over her 35 years in congress maxine waters has missed 90% of congressional meetings.”known in some circles as “the poverty pimp,” waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for president that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.on top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.while the word “color” may have been been “congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the waters credo.then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. she has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.still, america was well aware that waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!sources: teddy stick – 1tch

0	police in vernal heights, florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.according to vernal heights chief of police, gregory moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.police arrived at 3845 toolson lane (the home of william provost) at approximately 7:45 pm on sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.when the officers arrived at 3845 toolson lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – enya’s ‘who can say’.after attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.the responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.according to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old william provost, 51-year-old dennis ratcliff, and 36-year-old michael dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.william provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:“i find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. if expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, i would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so i stick to what works for me”.upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.in addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their vernal heights residence.vernal heights chief of police, gregory moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.“though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. that said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that i’ve ever heard.”provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old dennis ratcliff, and 36-year-old michael dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that provost took them under his wing in late-2012.as of tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 toolson lane.all three men are currently being held without bail at the vernal heights municipal jail.

0	i woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:bill clinton: ‘natural’ for foundation donors to seek favorshere’s google:naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did bill clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. it plays right into the idea that the clinton foundation is all about pay to play, just like donald trump has been saying all along. unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.“it was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. and i trusted the state department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning. source: cnnin other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. leaked emails have shown that some clinton foundation donors have gotten meetings with clinton and that others were turned down. there is zero evidence of pay to play. in other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the trump foundation. trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. he does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. he also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in a september 13 cnn interview that his office is investigating trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to new york charity laws. the investigation launched amid reports from the washington post that trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” source: media mattersmedia matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote trump at the cost of clinton’s candidacy:journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as the washington post’s reporting about the trump foundation. this week, both the trump foundation and trump organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of donald trump’s dr. oz stunt.all of this biased coverage is hurting clinton and helping trump. trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.featured image via ethan miller/getty images.
0	former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation.the congressional report, titled,“the clinton foundation and the india success story,” was initiated by rep. marsha blackburn, a tennessee republican and vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee.the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.the congressional report focused on clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy, which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv/aids drugs to third world countries.it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur, a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the u.s. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm. the company was vulnerable to u.s. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the u.s. market.ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.the department of justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.“this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said u.s. attorney for the district of maryland rod j. rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty.“when companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the fda’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said stuart f. delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice, when the government announced its action against the indian company.the department of justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.“the question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf.the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign.blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state, where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obama’s first term.the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian-americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration (fda) and the securities and exchange commission.the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation’s vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda.it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs.propublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the u.s. agency for international development allocated $9 million to ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”“substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from hiv-related infections,” roger bate, an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told thedcnf.thakur told thedcnf that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients.“these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize,” he said.ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in august 2004, one year after chai began working with the firm. the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa, according to the report.the fda sent a public “warning letter” to ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. it concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral hiv/aids medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”although ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the u.s., chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the company’s hiv/aid drugs to patients abroad.bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy.thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “i have tried to reach out to them,” he told thedcnf. “but i haven’t had a great amount of success with the clinton foundation.”chai was a part of the clinton foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. bill clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.charles ortel, a wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”“in the application, trustees of the new entity, including bill clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. this is not true. they purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘chai’ was by far the largest piece of the original foundation,” ortel told thedcnf.the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.he signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the u.s. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘sub-saharan country’ relating to hiv/aids medicines or technologies,” the report states.chai announced in october 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: ranbaxy; cipla of mumbai, india; matrix labs of hydrabad, india; aspen pharmacare of johannesburg, south africa.chai’s endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the u.s. government under the president’s emergency plan for aids relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former president george w. bush.the flow of u.s. funds combined with clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the fda, according to the congressional study. eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic hiv drugs.the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years,” the report states.the study also examined the key players in the clinton-chai orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions.one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation, which clinton co-founded with indian-american businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in 2001.rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined $9 million in a securities and exchange commission investigation. one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill $3.3 million without board approval.blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the clinton foundation.“you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. to me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author

0	after collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in new york city, hillary clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the hillary at chelsea clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. the nose on the hillary clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of hillary in the past.the different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real hillary clinton has what is known as the nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. the clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a roman type.aside from the different nose types, the clone hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, hillary clinton does.since the real hillary clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those bill clinton will do himself.the question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with donald trump that are coming up? or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?what we need to look for immediately is her appearance. if she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real hillary clinton. if she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not hillary clinton.the biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real hillary clinton ever be seen or heard as president of the united states? or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, state of the union addresses, and speeches? it could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the swearing in.it is a very big possibility that the real hillary clinton may not even play a part of a new clinton administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.if anyone thought president obama may not be who he claims he is, such a clinton administration being conducted entirely without hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about obama seem inconsequential.the american people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in barack h obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as president. hillary clinton may be the first administration in us history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
0	donald trump is, well, deplorable. he’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for muslims like hitler did with the jews, forcing said muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” he’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:“the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. they care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. when they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”but he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, he also wants to bring that idea home. in a statement on the bombings in new york and new jersey over the weekend, the donald’s senior communications advisor explained that trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of barack obama and hillary clinton. and trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on u.s. soil on president obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every american. it is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full u.s. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by president obama and hillary clinton. even worse, clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more americans at risk. the threat from radical islamic terrorism has only grown under obama and clinton, and isis has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. our enemies neither fear nor respect hillary clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. mr. trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike obama and clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.pay attention to that last bit: “they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”now, we already know that the problem according to the gop presidential nominee is “radical islamic terrorism,” and that trump has (numerous times) blamed muslims in general for any attacks he could. exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”“they’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” trump said in march. “when they see trouble, they have to report it. they are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”if muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in trump’s eyes? how many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows islam was rounded up? would there be mass exterminations? trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. how would he define terrorism?these are all questions it is unlikely that mr. trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “second amendment people” could deal with them. we’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.it’s also important to remember that the attacks in new york and new jersey were committed by an american citizen — one with constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. this, of course, matters not to the donald.normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. but not with trump. he’s said it himself. many times.if we allow this alleged human, this oompa loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. be sure to vote in november if it’s the last thing you do. if trump wins, it may be.featured image via getty images/joe raedle

0	when president obama spoke at the united nations he espoused the one world government. he speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: as if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” if that is what he is for, then god help us.as written by alex pfeiffer for daily caller:‘collision of cultures’in his last address before the united nations tuesday, president barack obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.“i believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” obama said. “in order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”the president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..
0	back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish white house state dinners – the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.i don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the clinton family and their well-connected friends. the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. that way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.the daily caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:just 5.7 percent of the clinton foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s irs filings. the rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” the clinton foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s irs filings show. but less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. that number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851k was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. the foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. this was nothing more than a way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money. and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com

0	i can’t wait for “weekend at chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. cnn and the rest of hillary clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. if this woman, god forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.the american people aren’t buying it. this is a severely ill woman. no more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. mrs. clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” i mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).this guy has been spotted with the clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a diazepam pen. diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.blue tinted glasses of the sort mrs. clinton was wearing sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. these therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate mrs. clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).the clinton campaign needs to come clean. they won’t, but they should. i wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm secret service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “nothing to see here, folks. secretary clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”the point is that, once more, by lying about illness mrs. clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. she’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. she has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. she’s a liar. that’s her default mode. she’s corrupt. and she’s sick. very sick. she puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.do i take joy in mrs. clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? well, no on the first, yes on the second. “do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (proverbs 24:17).indeed, mrs. clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of donald trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. this is the same hillary clinton who once called the late sen. robert byrd, d-w.va., her “friend and mentor.” sen. byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable kkk. this is the same hillary clinton whose husband, former president bill clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that president obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose democratic party opposed the 1964 civil rights act while republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same hillary clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the u.s. while hundreds-of-thousands of republicans gave up their lives to free them.who’s the racist?i’m praying for hillary clinton. despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. to watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. you can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.it’s almost tragic to witness. hillary clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous bs she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the oval office, not as first lady, but as president of the united states. proverbs 19:21 says, “many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the lord’s purpose that prevails.”am i saying there’s no chance hillary clinton will win? not at all, though i think it unlikely. between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for hillary clinton’s political aspirations. even so, i also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.when they visit her in prison.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com

0	obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the u.n. assembly. during it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating isis and other islamic extremist groups in syria and otherwise. he spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his "jv team."seeing as the u.s. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.the daily caller reports that obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the islamic state group. he cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution."if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long," said obama.president obama continued by saying that we must "be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy."he mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the islamic state group he also categorized syria as "a place like syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won."instead obama suggested that we "pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect."which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.it's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical islam and death and violence. these are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected muslim terrorist.it's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some jv team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.it's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. we're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. if we don't take action soon, then obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.make sure to share this on facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical islam.source: conservative tribune
0	thanks in part to the declassification of defense intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most middle east observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group isis and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the cia and dia, as far back as 2012.and purposely created by the obama administration in part to isolate the syrian government of president bashar al-assad. the documents also predicted that the support given by the west, turkey and the persian gulf arab states to the takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a salafist principality in eastern syria.according to investigative reporter nafeez ahmed, the "leaked document reveals that in coordination with the gulf states and turkey, the west intentionally sponsored violent islamist groups to destabilize assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘islamic state’ in iraq and syria.”obviously obama’s dismissal of isis being nothing more than a “jv” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most middle eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.however the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside libya before the 2012 terror attack in benghazi.and the report leaves no doubt that u.s. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from benghazi to syrian ports.however what isn’t in dispute is that american servicemen and woman and those in benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine middle eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our national security.here is a link to the judicial watch press release detailing the released documents.here are the released documents themselves.
0	after collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in new york city, hillary clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the hillary at chelsea clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. the nose on the hillary clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of hillary in the past.the different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real hillary clinton has what is known as the nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. the clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a roman type.aside from the different nose types, the clone hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, hillary clinton does.since the real hillary clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those bill clinton will do himself.the question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with donald trump that are coming up? or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?what we need to look for immediately is her appearance. if she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real hillary clinton. if she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not hillary clinton.the biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real hillary clinton ever be seen or heard as president of the united states? or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, state of the union addresses, and speeches? it could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the swearing in.it is a very big possibility that the real hillary clinton may not even play a part of a new clinton administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.if anyone thought president obama may not be who he claims he is, such a clinton administration being conducted entirely without hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about obama seem inconsequential.the american people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in barack h obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as president. hillary clinton may be the first administration in us history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
0	breaking: did hillary clinton have a nervous breakdown?rumors have surfaced that hillary clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.in this video we posted yesterday, clinton appears to lose eye control. shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in north carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. however it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about hillary clinton’s schedule.interesting fact….i just searched hillary clinton’s rally events scheduled between september 20 – october 19 – she has one scheduled. the rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. trump has four rallies scheduled between september 20-22!!!!there are many questions about her health, and admittedly i’m no expert. however i am a realist.i recently posted that hillary clinton needed secret service to help her up two steps at this very rally. what healthy person needs help up two steps? and the secret service man had a vice grip on clinton’s left hand.i further predicted that hillary clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.further rumors are the dnc is scrambling, as potential replacements for clinton are being sought. the democrats have a major problem here, as sanders remains a sock puppet for hillary clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.no matter who the democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned hillary clinton as the best and only choice. remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the dnc has the emails to prove it.as for hillary clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, clinton is ill. the left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to america what we already know about democrats. they are crooked to their black cores.expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.
0	it was late one night in the white house when obama first came up with the idea for isis. he hadn’t been sleeping well. michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch princess bride, but he’d made it all the way to the billy crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and michelle had started snoring. the snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. he had to get out of there.first, he headed down to the oval office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. for a long time, he just wandered around the west wing alone. he was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. he peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. he was thinking about stealing a kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: isis. he grabbed a post-it note and wrote it down. what was it? what did it mean?it wasn’t until months later, at coachella, that the idea started to take shape. obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the djs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the secret service allowed him to go to the music festival. they would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight european-style bathing suit and just dance. the people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“hey, bro, it’s the president!” “yeah, bro!”) the president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. he had done a tiny bit of molly with a french canadian woman named bonjour when the word “isis” came back to him. ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. he’d just never had the right idea. people had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. wait. of course. he went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled post-it note. yes. he would be the first american president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called isis. bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. he gave her his flower crown, got in an uber, and drove straight back to washington. by the time he got home, he had a plan.at first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “i want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. they’d laugh and say something like, “hey, mr. president, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the hbo show how to make it in america. then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was hillary.they were down in the kitchen one night eating popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. hillary laughed and said, “is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” he looked at her and said, “yes, actually.” she stopped eating her popsicle. “donald trump was right about you?” he nodded. “about everything.”he explained that he had actually been born in kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. he’d made an american birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) he explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the united states so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.“isn’t that the plot of the first season of homeland?” hillary asked. obama nodded. “kind of. also a little bit of the americans.”no one had come close to guessing his secret, until donald trump. he didn’t know what had given it away. he’d been so careful. had donald trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his portuguese water dog, bo? “wait, what?” hillary asked. she was starting to freak out. obama explained that bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that donald trump had seen that bo’s eyes were really tiny led screens. “did you know that when bo barks,” obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”hillary was quiet for a long time. she had stopped eating her popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. when she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “you’re a 97-year-old kenyan muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy america?” obama nodded. hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “i feel like i’m short-circuiting!” obama did his best to comfort her. “bo does that sometimes. then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”hillary was breathing hard. she walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in aly raisman’s floor routine. obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. he felt light and loose. he felt 87 again. he took her hands into his. “i’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” hillary apologized. “do you mean a fin?” obama asked. they both chuckled with their mouths closed. hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “but i haven’t even told you the best part yet. i’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it isis.”“isis?”“no, isis. all caps.”hillary and obama talked for hours that night. when they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the rose garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. they lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy washington sky as obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. when she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the western world wash over her like the hot summer air. she interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. he said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. she interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. he told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.he was starting to regret telling her about isis, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “we’ll wait until i’m president, and then we will secretly destroy america together.” her words shot through him. his heart was beating fast. that was it. that was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. in the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the popsicle had been. she looked scary, like jodie foster in nell. a weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. he couldn’t stop smiling. for the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. they put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. pretty soon, it was morning again.
0	posted by frank wilkenmeyer on 19 sep 2016we’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. one of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after george hw bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. what donald trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in chelsea and minnesota may have that beat:.@jasonmillerindc: statement on last weekend’s terror attacks https://t.co/dzlivkchmb pic.twitter.com/l3evtvlcfo — official team trump (@teamtrump) september 19, 2016take a look at that and consider what it says. the personal attacks on president obama and secretary clinton aside, trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in america. he didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.let’s imagine for a moment that trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. while the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in america. he’s talking about profiling muslims. he’s talking about donald trump’s version of the patriot act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.the man being hunted by the fbi, for example, isn’t just a muslim, he’s anthe man being hunted by the fbi, for example, isn’t just a muslim, he’s an american citizen with the right to due process. just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. with this blanket trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. there’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.what that means is that under trump’s dream regime, we could expect muslim heavy neighborhoods like dearborn and queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. without a way to differentiate christian arabs from muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? if you think i’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an american presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. it isn’t about the narrative. it isn’t about prevention or education.it’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. it may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, donald trump just became even more frightening.the only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. the thought of turning our streets into a denzel washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. like the rest of donald trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.featured image from file
0	with the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the soviet union and north korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities army chief of staff gen. ray odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.speaking at the ausa institute of land warfare global force symposium and exposition in huntsville, alabama, the general said; “the army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go."however the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. it began early within the obama administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to isis all across the middle east and into north africa. and aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.the general went on to explain; "today our nation is facing enormous challenges. i believe we are at a strategic inflection point," odierno said. "our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. we continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago."the army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. investment in modernization is down by 25%, odierno said, sidelining "much-needed" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.
0	what would possess anyone to take control of the internet away from the united states and put it under control of icann, composed of 182 foreign countries? that cannot bode well for freedom of speech, thought, and ideas. senator ted cruz leads the fight in these videos. congress must act now!as written by senator ted cruz:the obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, icann, that includes 162 foreign countries. if that proposal goes through, countries like russia, china, and iran could be able to censor speech on the internet, including here in the u.s. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.right now, the obama administration’s proposal to give away the internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many americans don’t know anything about. it is scheduled to go into effect september 30, 2016. congress must act before it’s too late!see more here:don’t let obama give away the internet | ted cruz | u.s. senator for texas

0	in every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. the national democratic party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.[ read related article: the democratic party: america’s most powerful hate groupas a christian and constitutional conservative who has studied political science and understands what the democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the united states, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “hillary the horrible” into the presidency in the november, 2016 election.a proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. however, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the democratic party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the november election for president – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.the proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. this translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo id that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. the democratic party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential democratic party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, hillary the horrible, to become the next and last president of the soon-to-be-extinct united states of america.due to the unfortunate fact that the democratic party, the obama administration, our treasonous congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the american people have as our only recourse in the november election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.donald trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on friday, september 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. the democratic party, america’s most powerful “hate group,” not only wants “hillary the horrible” to be elected and transform america into a dictatorship and hell on earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.let us agree that november 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the national democratic party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in america who value constitutional conservatism and our judeo-christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. if trump is to win, and hillary the horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt national democratic party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the conservative pro-american public.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
0	a daisy of a reruni am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in presidential campaigning. that being the tv advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.the year was 1964 and the incumbent president lyndon b johnson “approved” that message. only problem was that he followed the course in vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, barry goldwater.today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting johnson’s deceitful war policies, goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our nation’s media.i mention this as a backdrop of our current presidential campaign. just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each clinton failure. such a rendering, depicting reasons why clinton is unworthy of the presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “daisy” remake aimed against trump, has been mentioned. that being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the clinton staffers.somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against clinton as i previously mentioned, its message could outweigh goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” with the recent about-face announcement from ted cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.now, another unbalanced ap report unfolded, this one detailing ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided republican party.” this in addition to previous statements in which cruz called trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”as the article relates, trump countered with his nickname of “’lyin ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the john f. kennedy assassination.” these actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.schools of journalism teach that americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. so, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. i say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. this exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.it is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. this extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the ap ignores, needs no further explanation.also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the candy crowley faux pas. especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. in an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its ap exclusion.these quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.with that, consider the president’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, obama stated of hillary, “she will say anything and change nothing. hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be president.”obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about benghazi had yet to occur. not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.also during that same campaign, future first lady michelle offered this opine: “if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the white house.”apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? that type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
0	we’re shocked — shocked — to learn that cnn’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.first came lester holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked donald trump’s record and answers while leaving hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.now cnn has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.according to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that hillary won the debate. but what cnn didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were republicans. while independents made of 33%, democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.not to be outdone, nbc followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more democrats than republicans.
0	the democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. if you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. that is the outright claim of lynn sweet washington bureau chief for the chicago sun-times made on fox news. consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. what is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?first of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. this is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. secondly, the social security number presented of barack obama was issued in connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? no, only a cry of racism when the request is made. they can’t produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of “birther” and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of. sadly, donald trump has bowed to their…the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com
0	once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across europe. they wouldn’t listen anyway.in may of 2016, aaron woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to brighton & hove news.“the victim, a 26-year-old from eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” sussex police reported.according to the victim’s friend, brian markintosh, when woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this muslim stuff … aaron was in so much pain. he was really screaming.”"gay-bashing" incident“he’s such a gentle giant. he’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. he was filming the young gay guys,” markintosh added.near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.“i am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in brighton over the last two weekends,” sgt. peter allan said. “i am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”no matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. that being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?wrong. shariah law, the islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.many american muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. but in the end, radical islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what aaron woods learned, to his sorrow.
0	a man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in st. cloud, minnesota on saturday night. he began shouting allahu akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.the attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were muslim before stabbing the person.the attacker has now been identified as somali immigrant, dahir adan, a muslim.dahir adandahir adanst. cloud somali-american community members are the ones who identified adan as the terrorist, reported sc times.on sunday isis claimed that adan was one of their own.adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a marine corps race in new jersey, a muslim man attacking new york police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in chelsea, manhattan that injured 29 civilians on saturday.members and officials of the st. cloud somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.the somali officials said that adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).jason falconerofficer jason falconer of the avon, minnesota police departmentst. cloud mayor dave kleis reported to the media that adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, jason falconer. kleis called falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”falconer approached adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. that’s when adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.officer falconer then proceeded to send adan to allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.last year the washington times reported that obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand somali refugees to minnesota.the times went on to say that somalis are targeted by terror groups such as isis for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on american malls.“this population is also being targeted by islamist terror organizations like the islamic state and al-shabab, a somalia-based group with links to al qaeda, according to u.s. officials.”“among minnesota-based somali-americans, american converts to islam or somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-shabab or other islamist groups.”“al-shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the mall of america in minnesota. al-shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the westgate shopping mall in kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.”in july of this year, world net daily reported that somali refugees in minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.in may, voice of america news reported that isis has steadily grown stronger in somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.“pro-islamic state somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from yemen, a top intelligence official told the voa somali service.”“he said islamic state has welcomed its somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in yemen.”“they received military supplies from yemen – weapons, uniform, isis sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,” he said.in june, three somalians living in minnesota were convicted of trying to join isis.in july, the somali terror group al-shabab was approached by isis officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack america.department of homeland security documents show that while hillary clinton served as secretary of state, over 31,000 somali refugees were relocated to the united states.u.s. issued green cards to migrants from muslim nations over the last 5 yearsif hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of muslim refugees from syria alone by over 500%.breitbart news reported that under a clinton administration, the total number of muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.it’s clear that muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by isis and other terror groups. it’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in minnesota.men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single isis convert. and hillary clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.hillary cannot be allowed to become president. under her rule, terror attacks on u.s. citizens will increase exponentially. all because she and the dnc want to pander to islamists in the hope that they will vote democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.a vote for hillary is a vote for isis and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing american men, women, and children.don’t vote for isis hillary on november 8th. vote trump to keep america safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to allah where they belong.selah.from freedom daily
0	196 shares facebook twitterfor a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.would you believe that the man behind saturday’s nj and nyc bombings once claimed to be a victim of “islamophobia?” this was allegedly such a problem that the attacker ahmad khan rahami and his father once sued the police in elizabeth new jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.the journalists over at the daily mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of louder with crowder):the prime suspect in the new york and new jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a muslim. ahmad rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in elizabeth, new jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. the family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called first american, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. ahmad, 28, his father mohammad sr, 53, and his brother mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘muslims don’t belong here’. the lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.no, you’re not living in an episode of the twilight zone right now, this is real life.mayor christian bollwage insisted to the new york times that there was no such discrimination. “it was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” bollwage said, adding, “it had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth, nj called first american fried chicken. this is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station monday morning. his lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.welcome to obama’s america – where even an islamic terrorist can play the victim!how insane is this? get the word out – share this post on facebook and twitter.
0	for decades, employers have been holding america hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.it hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a ceo be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (republican) loses. four years ago, it was “papa” john schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if obamacare went through. it did and he didn’t.this year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. andy puzder is the ceo of carl’s jr. and hardee’s. here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:judging by the commercials, like donald trump, puzder likely cares little about political correctness. but that’s not the reason he wants a republican in office. he just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. in an op-ed in the wall street journal, puzder says that if a democrat wins, either democrat, he will fully automate his stores. speaking about an automated fast food system named eatsa, puzder wrote:“i want to try it,” ceo andy puzder told business insider of his automated restaurant plans. “we could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “with government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “you’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “this is the problem with bernie sanders, and hillary clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says puzder. “does it really help if sally makes $3 more an hour if suzie has no job?” source: yahoo financethis threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. across the country, puzder has about 20,000 employees. he’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. one has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.puzder is doing just fine. in 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. his profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. in fact, puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.you can guarantee, though, that even if a republican wins the white house and the minimum wage stays the same, puzder will still be automating. that’s just the way he is: profits over people.
0	the fbi has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against hillary clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. the new evidence was discovered during an investigation into anthony weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of clinton’s top aide huma abedin.apparently, abedin and weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the fbi. what this might mean is many of the deleted hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the fbi. if any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both hillary and huma abedin lied to the fbi during their original investigation. lying to the fbi is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute hillary clinton and huma abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. this story is still developing, but considering the fact the fbi released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.on july 5th, 2016, fbi director james comey laid out the evidence against hillary clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. since then, many high ranking officials within the fbi and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with director comey’s decision. meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the fbi.a high-ranking fbi official told fox news that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “it was unanimous that we all wanted her [clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”“it is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior fbi official told fox news. “we were floored while listening to the fbi briefing because comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — fox newsupdate october 17, 2016:the fbi has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the fbi investigation into hillary clinton’s private e-mail server. the documents claim a state department official “pressured” the fbi into declassifying information in one of clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. both the fbi and state department deny the deal was ever struck.the fbi summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of state department officials that some called “the shadow government” who met weekly to discuss freedom of information requests related to hillary clinton. as well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by hillary clinton, and her staff as secretary of state. there was even one incident where clinton ignored security advice that “placed clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — bbc newsupdate october 25, 2016:according to the the wall street journal, a longtime clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an fbi official’s wife who later investigated hillary clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.uncovering the cover up: reddit exposes paul combettain september of 2016, several reddit users exposed the identity of reddit user “stonetear”, as paul combetta, an it specialist who worked on hillary clinton’s private e-mail server. in fact, mr. combetta was granted immunity by the justice department for his involvement in the investigation, even though paul combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from clinton’s private e-mail server.mr. combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a vip from a bunch of archived e-mails.it was assumed at the time that the vip being referenced in the post was hillary clinton. however, new evidence released today suggests the vip was in fact the president of the united states of america.wikileaks podesta e-mails release 7: october 14, 2016on march 4, 2015, just hours after hillary clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the justice department, john podesta, the chairman of the hillary clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to cheryl mills, an attorney who works for the clinton campaign:from:john.podesta@gmail.com to: cheryl.mills@gmail.com date: 2015–03–04 20:41 subject: special categorythink we should hold emails to and from potus? that’s the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but i seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545in other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain hillary clinton’s communications with president obama. which means both hillary clinton, and obama lied to the fbi, justice department, congress, and the american people. we now have definitive proof obama was communicating with hillary clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.update october 25, 2016: wikileaks podesta e-mails release 18 confirms intent of cover upon march 7th, president obama lied to the press and told the american people he found about hillary clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. cheryl mills, an attorney

rottenberg, another clinton attorney, admits hillary clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.i know when i talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. while we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents and why further hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. it smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing i’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099the reason fbi director comey did not press charges against hillary clinton was due to a lack of intent. he made the argument that hillary clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.however, that was before the american people knew that hillary clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with president obama, and before we had proof that hillary clinton deleted e-mails personally. she also instructed paul combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the justice department. this proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, president obama.this suggests the white house illegally subverted the fbi investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the president’s communications with her. meanwhile, by protecting hillary, the white house was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. by securing the white house for another 4-years it will prevent the american people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.when you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the podesta e-mails on wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the clinton campaign, and the white house. in effect, the white house is using the main stream media to elect clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the fbi, congress, and the american people.timeline of events:march 2, 2015: the new york times breaks the story that clinton used a personal e-mail account while secretary of

0	germany’s chancellor angela merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.this quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto german cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.the german people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to merkel’s conservative democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”according to the daily mail,speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘a continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like germany,’ she said. the leader, once known as the ‘iron chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. however, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘we want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in karlsruhe. ‘with an approach focused on the german, european and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with western values, it’s not great for a free society. but as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.beware, america. beware.(source: daily mail)
0	8.1k shares facebook twitterwhat a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in new jersey and new york city saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. it sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in obama’s america.we’re all aware of the scandal at the veteran’s administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the va had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. as bizpacreview reported:“we have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) rahami. “thank you, law enforcement. thank you, police.” then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “but the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said trump. “he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. and on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”watch below:wouldn’t it be nice if our veterans received the same treatment? instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the va. there are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in va parking lots.we can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?i can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless americans due to his religious ideology. admittedly, i think i’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.

0	978 shares facebook twitteri don’t recall in any presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. not only is hillary clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of presidential polls. the polls continue to show a hillary decline as hillary continues to show a health decline.here are the top takeaways from the poll:•more than 40% of registered voters now believe that clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between september 12 and 13. that’s a sharp departure from another morning consult poll taken just at the end of august, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.•the share of voters who think clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. by contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late august, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of clinton).•voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about clinton’s potential medical issues.while hillary clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. my mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than hillary, at least. usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. i can’t see hillary as a hard drug user but lately i have grown suspicious of hillary’s health. the suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.at one point it was reported that hillary was taking coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. it was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from parkinson’s, alzheimer’s, and multiple sclerosis. even her assistant huma abedin was caught talking about hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.and then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. recently, another damning picture came out with hillary unable to get up stairs alone. while this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.then there are pictures like this where hillary is literally being held up while talking. it would be more rare to find a picture of hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.here’s an interesting video on how the video of hillary passing out at the 9/11 memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. it is obvious that hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. if you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. i believe that the events are purposely not being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.and of course the coughing pictures, america has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. she might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the us, ever. not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air. it’s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *cough cough hmhmm uck khoff khak khak gack — *gasp excuse me, president of the united states.

0	6.6k shares facebook twittergerman chancellor angela merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. she is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. merkel told the media at a press conference,“if i knew what change in refugee policy the people in germany want, i would be prepared to consider it.”these comments came shortly after the defeat of the christian democratic union in berlin’s sunday elections. she also said,“if i could, i would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”she took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the mecklenburg-vorpommern election. callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.the results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many germans now have. as well as the rise of the anti mass migration alternative for germany known as afd. these factors have forced merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. in other words it is all talk and no walk. she is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.however, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the christian social union. they have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into germany each year. they specifically want to cap it at 200,000. as well, they want to prioritize christian migrants over muslims. but merkle will not budge on that.merkel stated,“if people don’t want muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to germany’s. the cdu and i cannot go along with that.”christian social union party leader horst seehofer threatened to withdraw support for merkle during her 2017 campaign. specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. the campaign will be in the federal election. he said,“it is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”the growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. understandably so. if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.this could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. or at least win by an only marginal amount. serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as president obama’s and hillary clinton’s. she is no different which is why many americans too cannot stand her.
0	1.6k shares facebook twittermuslim somali asylum seeker, abdullah, in sundsvall, sweden is a bastard! abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. this aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to sweden 5 years ago. his most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.he had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting must be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.the story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his muslim right to punish his pregnant wife for her disobedience comes into play. he forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. he then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. that is strange to me since muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, i wonder why it was there in the first place. he then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.thank you mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. especially when pregnant.quran 4:34 — so righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what allah would have them guard. but those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. but if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. indeed, allah is ever exalted and grand.just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the islamic prophet muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.i wonder where it says you can pick and choose which edicts from the quran and hadith you want to obey? this guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. i believe the quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but i guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times or someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for muslims which he is following.
0	pennsylvania republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on election day in support of donald trump.first proposed in june, house bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.in other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.as brennan center for justice counsel adam gitlin told propublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.“there’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” gitlin said. “that can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”as we all know, conservatives who support trump are racists who think their brand of christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a muslim.and that’s exactly what republican nominee donald trump wants.“we’re going to watch pennsylvania,” trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. if you do that, we’re not going to lose. the only way we can lose, in my opinion – i really mean this, pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “stop crooked hillary from rigging this election!”in response to trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, pennsylvania republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.with the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, pennsylvania is even more important now. but voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. in short, trump and the republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. and if it works in pennsylvania you can bet that republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.featured image: jeff swensen/getty images

0	when donald trump said that he wanted to ban muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.oh how wrong they were, and still are.first off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. this is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.the insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the democrats. after seeing how the world is working, trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. well, this has got to sting:a new poll has found that 49 percent of australians support a ban on muslim immigration, a huge jump from last october when only 28 percent backed the idea. the essential research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of australians agree that populist senator pauline hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. the top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that muslim migrants do not integrate nor share australian values. the poll was first conducted in early august and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.so australians want to preserve australian values? that sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. yet, when trump says “america first” it’s suddenly racist.ok, yeah, that sounds logical.sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing coalition favour an end to muslim migration along with 40 per cent of labour voters and 34 per cent of green voters. “floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan australia”, is too big to ignore. he writes: “this not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “yes, they are more likely to vote coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of labor voters and one third of greens agree too. look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with hanson.”do you hear that, hillary? this is how you respond to people who oppose you. you don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. let’s get this done in november.(source: breitbart)

0	we need a border wall. it is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into america.law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. police in luna county, new mexico, pulled over an undocumented middle eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.(via mad news world)police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.the plans detailed a pipeline in deming, new mexico. the fbi’s joint terrorism task force was deployed with the u.s. border patrol to investigate the area. the search came up empty.the pipeline identified in the muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.it is troubling to discover an undocumented muslim woman in a county sharing a border with mexico.a report released by judicial watch in 2015 revealed that mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. the report indicates that mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.judicial watch also revealed in a 2017 report that mexico-based islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into america to scout out potential targets.congress should approve funding for president trump’s border wall at once. it is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into america.many of the illegal immigrants entering america are not even from mexico. instead, aliens from south of mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the american-mexican border. many of these aliens receive active support from the mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.if a terrorist wanted to sneak into america to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. they could start their journey south of mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.the only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. until we do, our country is easy pickings.
0	we’re shocked — shocked — to learn that cnn’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.first came lester holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked donald trump’s record and answers while leaving hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.now cnn has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.according to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that hillary won the debate. but what cnn didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were republicans. while independents made of 33%, democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.not to be outdone, nbc followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more democrats than republicans.

0	someone had to say it. okay, liberals have been saying it for years. fox news (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. pope francis agrees. channeling franklin delano roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the pope chastised fear-based media.journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, pope francis said on thursday. spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “this is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” source: reutersnow, to be fair, pope francis was in italy and he was talking to italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but i’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. after all, fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us donald trump.crime in the nation is down. an american’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. still, trump, prompted on by fox news, is scaring the crap out of americans:fear is in the air, and fear is surging. americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: polls show majorities of americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. source: the atlanticsure, that’s about donald trump and the pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but fox is the fear network. forward progressives lists several examples of fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.featured image via franco origlia/getty images.
0	775 shares facebook twittercnn news has claimed through polling that hillary clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. but others indicate otherwise. snap polls show donald trump as the debate night winner. talking points included the birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and trump’s tax returns as well as other things.look at some of the snap polls below. they include time magazine, the drudge report, cbs new york, fox 5, and news 2 nashville among many others.donald trump took to twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. so far, hillary clinton has yet to comment on it. the cnn snap poll showed clinton at 62 percent and trump at 27 percent. which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that cnn poll. or the pool of people polled is off.521 people were polled by cnn but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more democrat. which would explain the results. despite clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. so even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as donald trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. that he should have brought up bill clinton’s infidelity. even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. which is odd considering he apparently won.with the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. let’s not forget that julian assange promised a few months back an october surprise release on wikileaks that would destroy hillary clinton’s campaign. we all must wait and see.

protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. the police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.one key eye witness report emerged from charlotte on twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from todd zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “i didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. let the record show.”my friend

carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. the 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:i watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. it was not by a civilian. i don't care what cnn tells you. i was right fucking there. — black matlock (@kahranatlaw) september 22, 2016“i didn’t realize that i was standing next to someone from cnn at the time. it started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. it was peaceful, people had signs that said “hands up, don’t shoot,” kahran meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.“the protest then marched to college street and trade street in front of the omni hotel. at that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” meyer told me almost breathlessly, “i’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. we wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”“after leaving ‘the epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. at that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. i swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. the charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.“it wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “it was much louder. it wasn’t a civilian injury. the way people scattered. no way. at least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘they just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. at that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”at that moment, meyers says that charlotte-mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. as she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.it took meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. according to meyer, that videographer was from cnn and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. it was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’cnn reports, “police say the person was shot by a civilian.”the city of charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on twitter:alert: fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @cmpd did not fire shot. — city of charlotte (@cltgov) september 22, 2016two additional eye witness reports have emerged on twitter refute the charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. the first is from the charlotte clergy coalition for justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed palestinian rights activist.“i saw the man go down on the pavement,” said minister steve knight of missiongathering christian church in charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at charlotte-meckenberg police for the shooting, “it was an ambush. the victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”#charlotte clergy question

0	46.8k shares share this storyrepublican nominee donald trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of vladimir putin, the dictator of the russian federation. he’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by russian state-controlled media and by russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of democratic party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.throughout all of this, trump has insisted that he has no business ties to russia. “for the record, i have zero investments in russia” he tweeted in july. now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.an abc news investigation has found that donald trump has “numerous ties” to russian interests both here in the united states and in russia. “the level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with russian businessmen. they were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with donald trump. and they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with donald trump” says sergei millian, who heads a u.s.-russia business group.trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 miss universe contest in moscow and selling trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of russian buyers – so many that the sunny and hollywood islands in florida became known as “little moscow.”the oligarchs of russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former soviet union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. towards the end of the boris yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all russian finance. now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.the oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing trump properties was a favored way to do so. it makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. they are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.“i think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. they spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…they don’t read books. they don’t go to [art] exhibitions. they think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former kgb agent alexander lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” sound like anyone we know?when the us state department leveled sanctions on the russian oligarchs in 2014 following moscow’s annexation of the crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. if trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and trump himself. “we’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said trump on the issue of sanctions in july.these business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential president and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the russian oligarchs and put a check on russian territorial aggression in eastern europe. would president trump be able to put his personal profits aside? if this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that trump cares about nothing but himself. we cannot allow him and his russian cronies to take their corruption to the white house.watch abc news’ report here:add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

0	11.3k shares share this storyduring a republican primary debate in september 2015, now-republican nominee donald trump said that he never lobbied florida governor jeb bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if i wanted it.” but if that is true, then donald trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as newsweek reports:one of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. but unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to trump’s mendacity is on full display: he makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. even though bush’s story reinforced what trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. instead, he looked america in the eye and lied. and then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: his people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in florida, regardless of bush’s opposition—if trump had wanted it.the transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which jeb bush would’ve full well known, as would have trump. because after trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into florida over the objections of an anti-gambling republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. eichenwald’s point is that either trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:now consider the other option, that trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. there, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by fields. the rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.why is all of this important? in the late 1990s, house republicans impeached democratic president bill clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. the entire media hounded president clinton over the whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a florida court of law under oath (it does seem like trump lives in the florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for president.see for yourself the two transcripts newsweek published and decide for yourself if trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the republican debate audience. compare the two options presented by eichenwald, there’s no third option here:bush: “the one guy that had some special interests that i know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was donald trump. he wanted casino gambling in florida.” trump interrupted bush: trump: i didn’t— bush: yes, you did. trump: totally false. bush: you wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because i was opposed to— trump: i would have gotten it. bush: casino gambling before— trump: i promise, i would have gotten it. bush: during and after. i’m not going to be bought by anybody. trump: i promise, if i wanted it, i would have gotten it. bush: no way. believe me. trump: i know my people. bush: not even possible. trump: i know my people.transcript of 2007 trial deposition:a lawyer asked trump, “did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” trump: a little bit. lawyer: what did you do? trump: i actually spoke with governor-elect bush; i had a big fundraiser for governor-elect bush…and i think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in trump tower in new york on fifth avenue. lawyer: when was that? trump: sometime prior to his election. lawyer: you knew that governor bush, jeb bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in florida, didn’t you? trump: i thought that he could be convinced otherwise. lawyer: but you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? trump: well, i never really had that much of an opportunity because fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

0	13.8k shares share this storys trump’s number one backer in silicon valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. the u.s. department of labor filed suit charging that palantir technologies, the palo alto technology company controlled by republican businessman peter thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. palantir is a federal government contractor to the nsa.sources say that donald trump wants to deliver a lifetime supreme court nomination to thiel, who despises the first amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. both the stanford law school grad thiel and trump’s campaign later denied the report. vanity fair noted that:according to the lawsuit, palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were asian. ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four asians and 17 non-asians. “the likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.ironically, peter thiel, the trump donor who bloomberg called the republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. thiel’s parents came to america to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.thiel was a paypal co-founder and early facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. the billionaire revealed himself in march to be hulk hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.but now, the entire world knows mr. thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the republican national convention in cleveland. thiel then called out the gop’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “every american has a unique identity. i’m proud to be gay, i’m proud to be a republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” he became the first ever openly gay speaker at the rnc to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-lgbt platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the bush administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.“federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the department of labor’s ofccp director patricia shiu. “our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” lisa gordon, a spokeswoman for palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to bloomberg news.now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president’s crimes. impeach donald trump!

0	back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish white house state dinners – the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.i don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the clinton family and their well-connected friends. the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. that way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.the daily caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:just 5.7 percent of the clinton foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s irs filings. the rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” the clinton foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s irs filings show. but less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. that number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851k was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. the foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. this was nothing more than a way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money. and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com

0	over the past several months, the american public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the clinton foundation since hillary clinton was secretary of state.well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. according to the daily caller, the foundation, aids program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.from the daily caller:former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation. — the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign. — the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian-americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration (fda) and the securities and exchange commission. the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation’s vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda. it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs.this latest report proves that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching bill and hillary!do you think that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world? share your thoughts below!
0	according to this, the arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.case in point.the specific law criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. for real.this is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, az parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.the az supreme court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” they ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. so much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?in others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. there’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. see? just trust them.wow.there are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. but here’s an especially interesting tidbit:as fordham law professor john pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: it utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in america are resolved. given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. with the state supreme court’s help, arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. this terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. barring intervention by the u.s. supreme court, due process has now been suspended for arizona’s parents and caregivers.yikes.but i’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. we should just trust the government on this, y’all. because doesn’t government always know best?
0	michelle obama not leaving the white house – hillary clinton has terrifying new role for her!?!?the idea that i might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the obamas is actually making me a little ill. i was done with them after the first few days of the barack obama presidency, but it would appear that hillary clinton has some roles for the president and first lady after her coronation election.what exactly is first lady michelle obama’s legacy? trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life i’m proud of my country.” i personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#bringbackourgirls” sign.but why remember her when one of the presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?*insert mechanical applause here*but what would her role be? what is she even qualified to do?it’s not hard to figure out what hillary clinton wants her to do when you remember that clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up your children. if you doubt that, read this tweet:× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy nowi mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?for an additional wave of nausea, read hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.of course, michelle obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by the washington post.back in february, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “i do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “i have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”this reeks of desperation. is hillary trying to capture the “i don’t like hillary, but i do like the obamas” vote? or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.either way, i’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of american children. the government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. that is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has ever come out of complete government control over the average citizen.
0	new clinton foundation scandal just broke – this is what hillary actually thinks about black people…this is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the clinton health access initiative. anything with ‘clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many africans. they distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. an indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the clintons know about it. i’m betting that they did.ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. the doj also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. so, one wonders why the clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.“this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said us attorney for the district of maryland rod j. rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty.from the daily caller:former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation. the congressional report, titled,“the clinton foundation and the india success story,” was initiated by rep. marsha blackburn, a tennessee republican and vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee. the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy now the congressional report focused on clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy, which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv/aids drugs to third world countries. it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur, a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the u.s. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm. the company was vulnerable to u.s. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the u.s. market. ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.“the question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked blackburn in an interview with the dcnf.this could definitely bring further scrutiny to the clinton charities and to the clintons themselves. right when they need it least. a congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between bill clinton and the two indian-americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the fda and the sec. what is very troubling is the clinton foundation’s aggressive promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda. it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs. but that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. all for money.propublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the us agency for international development allocated $9 million to ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from hiv-related infections,” roger bate, an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the dcnf.ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the us, but they are still selling and distributing hiv/aids drugs worldwide. the clinton foundation and clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.companies that partner with the clinton foundation and charities make a ton of money. corruption is rampant. bill and hillary clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary.
0	breaking: judge demands release of clinton’s security training files – she has 5 days…just like barack obama and many people in his orbit, hillary clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. there are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. they shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.the daily caller news foundation has been trying to get documents from the state department forever concerning clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. it’s called deniable plausibility. the daily caller news foundation filed a foia lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. will they see them before the election? a judge has ordered it… i wouldn’t hold my breath.from the daily caller:a frustrated federal judge ordered the state department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former secretary of state hillary clinton and her top aides. judge richard leon ruled tuesday in favor of the daily caller news foundation by rejecting the state department’s motion to dismiss thedcnf’s freedom of information act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the freedom of information act. but he also denied thedcnf’s request to depose state department officials. × 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy now the state department has been unable to produce any records confirming that clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. in addition to clinton, thedcnf seeks the same records for former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills, deputy chief of staff huma abedin and advisor jacob sullivan.huma abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. but these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, i don’t look for them to do so this time. and for some reason they are never held to account for it. the rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.judge richard leon is getting fed up with state department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. he ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by sept. 26th and the rest of them by oct. 10th. bradley moss, one of the attorneys representing thedcnf, said “judge leon’s order made clear his frustration with the state department’s continued obstruction of the foia process. state will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” i hope they carry through with those consequences this time. it’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. the word for this is ‘corruption’.state department officials admitted in a july 29th response to thedcnf that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by clinton or her aides. well, duh. that’s for peons, not the elite evidently.
0	there’s already been hints from nbc news that lester holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. this, of course, will allow trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by hillary clinton.but to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:while on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including univision and telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt, the only other person on the stage.after politico documented that trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. but sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to donald trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.the clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold trump accountable, with clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri telling reporters:for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage. we do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.unfortunately, with trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to hillary clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” this double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.hopefully, clinton will wipe the floor with trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the american people that she did it.if there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.featured image via sara d. davis/getty images

0	exposed: soros funding fake veterans’ pac to take trump downa couple months ago, discover the networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by soros. they have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, muslim migration and social justice. so, why then is soros caught again?now a new organization is going after trump and sure enough, they’re funded by soros too! it’s called ‘common defense pac’ and their mantra is: “as veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every american. we continue to fulfill this promise by standing against donald trump.”then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. on their social media you see the same stuff. they feature videos and materials from other pacs that are also funded by george soros. common defense pac shared one of its own anti-trump video ads, which has a common defense pac logo on it at the end, right underneath a url link to a moveon.org petition called “senator portman: disavow donald trump.”the pac routinely promotes the twitter hashtag #vetsagainsttrump, which is also promoted routinely by moveon.org. moveon.org’s political action arm has also put out advertising for the #vetsagainsttrump hashtag. × 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy now the common defense pac logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a thunderclap campaign called #standwithvets: #dumptrump.” the campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor mark ruffalo and leftist pundit van jones. moveon.org was listed as the organizer of the thunderclap campaign. moveon.org and common defense pac worked together on a live protest to pressure john mccain to “un-endorse donald j. trump.” thinkprogress reported on august 4th that veterans “came to the capitol to deliver mccain a petition, organized by progressive group moveon.org in conjunction with veterans group common defense pac, calling for him to revoke his support for the republican presidential nominee.”common sense pac’s july quarterly filing report with the fec lists only one donor: a baltimore it consultant named marjorie roswell who gave $20,000 on june 30th. and then the group’s director, perry o’brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. his ‘iraq veterans against the war’ bio describes him:perry o’brien served as a medic in afghanistan with the 82nd airborne division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. for several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. he has been an active member of iraq veterans against the war, and was a key organizer of winter soldier: iraq and afghanistan.the pac that’s suppose to be veterans against trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. you can hardly call that a veteran, right? o’brien personally started a moveon.org petition called “tell gop leaders to disavow trump and his attacks on veterans.” the petition is probably what grabbed soros attention to get o’brien to start the shallow pac. with all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy trump and funded by soros, do you think that trump stands a chance against the left?

0	boom! marines send terrorists scathing message [video]there’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. it’s because isis, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. with isis and other islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to islam and live their lives subservient to their muslim rulers. anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. isis even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.while the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. they welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.a series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that marines are ready for them. and it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the united states marine corps:× 101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins's book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. buy nowconsidering how many terrorist attacks the united states has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the marine corps to send this message to the terrorists. liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent americans from being able to defend themselves. who cares what they think?and this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. remember, what they want is to make people afraid. these billboards show that not only are the marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. if we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.sorry, isis. game over.share this on facebook if you agree with this badass statement!

0	advertisement - story continues belowthe first presidential debate between democrat nominee hillary clinton and republican rival donald trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.nbc’s lester holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.in one of the more contentious exchanges, holt insisted that trump had supported the iraq war from the beginning, but trump continuously denied it, usa politics today* reported.advertisement - story continues belowrather than ask clinton why she voted for the war, holt continued to press trump, saying that in an interview with fox news’ neil cavuto, trump expressed his support for the war.after the debate was over, cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.“you know, what happened to the days of douglas macarthur? i mean he would go in and attack. he wouldn’t talk. i mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” trump said.advertisement - story continues below“well, he’s (bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. perhaps we should be waiting for the united nations. you know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said trump, clearly unsure if invading iraq was the right choice.you can see it here:instead of hammering trump for his alleged “support” for the iraq war, the moderator really should have asked clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than trump did.advertisement - story continues belowit shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear trump’s name.luckily, trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both clinton and her media pals at the same time.share this on facebook and twitter and let us know what you thought of the debate on monday night.*usa politics today has since pulled their story.
0	well that’s weird. if the birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for obama?what if that person is … obama?breitbart put this out, taken from the ap, entitled ““kenyan-born obama all set for us senate” that was june 2004.kenyan-born us senate hopeful, barrack obama, appeared set to take over the illinois senate seat after his main rival, jack ryan, dropped out of the race on friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. the allegations that horrified fellow republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given obama a clear lead as republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. as far as we know, barack obama never refuted this article.it’s still out there on the internet. here’s a screen capture:here’s the bottom half of the same article with ap attribution.and the link to the original.that’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.that was obama’s publicist. here’s the quote:breitbart news has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by barack obama’s then-literary agency, acton & dystel, which touts obama as “born in kenya and raised in indonesia and hawaii.” the booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by acton & dystel. it also promotes obama’s anticipated first book, journeys in black and white–which obama abandoned, later publishing dreams from my father instead.if obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?if his birth in america is valid — as we are led to believe? why lie about it? unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. in which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. a harvard education, possibly.because if that wasn’t a lie… then something else must be. that ‘something else’ being his american birth and citizenship. which are prerequisites to his presidency.the quote can be read in context at breitbart.
